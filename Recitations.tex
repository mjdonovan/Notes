\subsection*{An 18.02A recitation on grpahing functions}

\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\item Define $f(x,y)=\sqrt{16-x^2-y^2}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For what values of $(x,y)$ is this function defined?
\item Draw the contours $z=4,2,0$. (What happens when $z>4$ or $z<0$?)
\item Find where $f(x,y)$ takes minimum/maximum values.
\item Calculate the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$, and check that these are zero at the maximum point.
\item Describe the surface.
\item Consider the parametric equation $r(t)=2\hat i + t\hat j + f(x_0,t)\hat k$. This is a curve parameterising the cross-section $x=1$. Calculate the velocity vector at $t=1$. 
\item Calculate $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\bigr|_{(2,1)}$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Define  $f(x,y)=1+|x-y|$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw the contours $z=2,1,0,-1,-2$.
\item Identify the direction of steepest ascent at the point $(x,y)=(1,0)$, (it should be perpendicular to the contour through that point).
\item How does the direction of steepest ascent relate to the vector $\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}|_{(1,0)},\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}|_{(1,0)}\right)$
\item Find where $f(x,y)$ takes minimum/maximum values.
\end{enumerate}
\item Define  $f(x,y)=e^{x}\sin y$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw the cross-sections $x=-1$, $x=0$ and $y=1$.
\item Draw the surface!
%\item Fix $x_0$, and parameterise a path $r(t)$ in $\R^3$ by $r(t)=x_0\hat i + t\hat j + f(x_0,t)\hat k$. This path traces out the cross-section $x=x_0$ of the graph. Calculate the velocity vector at $t=t_0$. How does it relate to the value of the partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}|_{(x_0,t_0)}$? To 1.
\end{enumerate}
%\item Define  $f(x,y)=\sin(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})$.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Draw the contours $z=1,0,-1$, and any more that you would like to.
%\item Draw the surface!
%\end{enumerate}
%\item Graph $f(x,y)=x^2y^2$
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Draw the contours $z=2,1,0,-1$.
%\item Draw the cross-sections $x=-1,x=0,x=1$.
%\item Draw the surface!
%\end{enumerate}
%\item Using these techniques, graph: $f(x,y)=x/|y|$.
\end{enumerate}
