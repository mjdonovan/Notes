\begin{SteenrodAlgebrasAndTheirKoszulDuals}
\subsection*{The Steenrod algebra for simplicial Lie algebras and its Koszul dual}
Let  $\LieSteen$ be the Steenrod algebra for simplicial restricted Lie algebras \cite[\S7]{PriddySimplicialLie.pdf}. This is the quotient of the standard Steenrod algebra by the two-sided ideal generated by $\Sq^0$. We'll introduce the notation $\SqShift^i:=\Sq^{i+1}$, so that $\LieSteen$ is generated by $\SqShift^i$ for $i\geq-1$, subject to relations:
\[\SqShift^{-1}=0\textup{ and }\SqShift^i\SqShift^j=\sum_{k=0}^{(a-1)/2}{j-k-1\choose i-2k-1}\SqShift^{i+j-k}\SqShift^k\textup{\ for $i\leq2j$.}\]
This is a homogeneous Koszul algebra in the sense of \cite{PriddyKoszul.pdf}. Its cohomology algebra $H^*\LieSteen:=\Ext_{\LieSteen}^{**}(\F_2,\F_2)$ is also a homogeneous Koszul algebra, generated by the $\LambdaOp^i$ for $i\geq0$, where $\LambdaOp^i$ is dual to $\SqShift^i$ \cite[\S8]{PriddySimplicialLie.pdf}. These classes satisfy their own Adem relations%footnote:
\footnote{Compare with \cite[p.143]{Miller-infDeloopSS.pdf}, and May-Cohen-Lada page 9.}:
\[\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^j=\sum_{k=0}^{(i-2j)/2-1}{i-2j-2-k\choose k}\LambdaOp^{2j+1+k}\LambdaOp^{i-j-1-k}\textup{\ for $i>2j$.}\]
Importantly, $H^*\LieSteen$ is isomorphic to the opposite of the $\Lambda$-algebra, and $\LambdaOp^i\longleftrightarrow\lambda_i$ under this anti-isomorphism. While it is not precisely true that the $\Lambda$-algebra has an unstable right action on the homotopy of any simplicial Lie algebra, there are various $\lambda$ operators acting thereupon, satisfying the Adem relations in the $\Lambda$-algebra when written on the right \cite[Prop 8.6]{CurtisSimplicialHtpy.pdf}. We prefer to think of this as a left action of various $\LambdaOp$ operators, in order to simplify notation. Details to follow.

\subsection*{The Steenrod algebra for simplicial commutative algebras and its Koszul dual}
It follows from Goerss' determination \cite[p.14]{MR1089001} of the cohomology of Eilenberg-Mac Lane objects in simplicial augmented commutative $\F_2$-algebras that the corresponding Steenrod algebra, $\Palgebra$ may be described thus.
Let $\Palgebra$ be the algebra generated by $P^i$ for $i\geq0$ subject to relations:
\[P^0=0,\ P^1=0\textup{ and }P^iP^jx=\sum_{s=i-j+1}^{i+j-2}{2s-i-1\choose s-j}P^{i+j-s}P^sx\textup{ for $i\geq2j$}.\]
The Quillen cohomology of a simplicial augmented $\F_2$-algebra has an unstable left action of this algebra. This is also a homogeneous Koszul algebra, as is its cohomology algebra $H^*\Palgebra=\deltaAlgebra$. The algebra $\Delta$ is generated by classes $\delta_i$ dual to $P^i$ for $i\geq 2$. These classes satisfy the following $\delta$-Adem relation:
\[\delta_i\delta_j:=\sum_{s=(i+1)/2}^{(i+j)/3}{j+s-i-1\choose j-s}\delta_{i+j-s}\delta_s\textup{ for $i<2j$.}\]
It is again not precisely true that $\deltaAlgebra$ acts on the homotopy of simplicial commutative algebras. There are, however, various $\delta$ operations acting on the homotopy of a simplicial commutative algebra, and they satisfy the $\delta$-Adem relation wherever it makes sense.

\begin{CategoriesOfInterest}
\section*{Categories of interest}
The following subsections we detail a number of algebraic categories relevant to our study.
\subsection*{Categories of graded sets and vector spaces}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item For $n\geq1$, let $\GpS{n}$ be the category of $n$-times non-negatively graded pointed sets $X$ whose graded part $X_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ is a single point whenever $a_1=0$. That is, an object $X\in\GpS{n}$ is a collection $X_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ of pointed sets, one for each $n$-tuple $(a_n,\ldots,a_1)$ of non-negative integers, such that $X_{a_n,\ldots,a_2,0}=\{\star\}$ for all $a_n,\ldots,a_2$. For $x\in X_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$, we write $|x|:=a_n$.
\item For $n\geq1$, let $\GS{n}$ be the category of $n$-times non-negatively graded sets $X$ whose graded part $X_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ is empty whenever $a_1=0$. For $x\in X_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$, we write $|x|:=a_n$.

\item For $n\geq1$, let $\GR{n}$ be the category of $n$-times non-negatively graded $\F_2$-vector spaces $V$ such that $V_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}=0$ whenever $a_1=0$.  For a nonzero homogeneous element $v\in V_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$, write $|v|:=a_n$.
\end{itemize}
All the categories $\mathsf{C}=\mathsf{C}^n$ to be defined below will consist of objects $X$ of $\GR{n}$ enriched with certain extra structure. For $y\in Y_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ a non-zero homogeneous element of $Y$, we will continue to write $|y|:=a_n$ in each of the following contexts.
Moreover, for any of the following categories there are free/forget adjunctions $\GS{n} \rightleftarrows \mathsf{C}$ and $\GpS{n} \rightleftarrows \mathsf{C}$. We'll denote either of these free functors simply by $X\mapsto\Fr{\mathsf{C}}(X)$.


\subsection*{Categories of graded Lie algebras}

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item For $n\geq1$, let $\BadLie{n}$ be the following category of $n$-graded Lie algebras over $\F_2$. An object of $\BadLie{n}$ is to be an object $L$ of $\GR{n}$ with (skew-)symmetric maps
\[[\DASH,\DASH]:L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}\otimes L_{b_n,\ldots,b_1}\to L_{a_n+b_n,\ldots,a_2+b_2,a_1+b_1+1}\]
satisfying the Jacobi identity. Note that this Lie bracket has degree $(0,\ldots,0,1)$. As the ground field has characteristic 2, the concepts of symmetry and skew-symmetry coincide. More importantly, skew-symmetry does not imply the `alternating' relation, so that there may be $x\in L$ with $[x,x]$ nonzero. This explains the $\mathsf{b}$ in the notation --- we refer to such Lie algebras as \emph{bad} Lie algebras.

\item For $n\geq1$, let $\GoodLie{n}$ be the full subcategory of $\BadLie{n}$ consisting of those Lie algebras which are \emph{good}. That is, those $L\in\BadLie{n}$ for which $[x,x]=0$ for all $x\in L$.
\item For $n\geq1$, let $\RestLie{n}$ be the category of restricted Lie algebras in $\GoodLie{n}$. That is, an object of $\RestLie{n}$ is an object $L\in\GoodLie{n}$ along with `restriction' operations
\[\restn{}:L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}\to L_{2a_n,2a_{n-1},\ldots,2a_2,2a_1+1}\]
which satisfy, for $x,y\in L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ and $z\in L$: \[\restn{(x+y)}=\restn{(x)}+\restn{(y)}+[x,y]\textup{ and }[\restn{x},z]=[x,[x,z]].\]
\item For $n\geq1$, let $\PRLie{n}$ be the following category of partially restricted $n$-graded \emph{good} Lie algebras. An object of $\PRLie{n}$ consists is an object $L$ of $\GoodLie{n}$
%For $n\geq1$, let $\PRLie{n}$ be the following category of partially restricted $n$-graded Lie algebras. An object of $\PRLie{n}$ is a good Lie algebra $L=\bigoplus L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$, under a $(0,\ldots,0,1)$-shifted bracket as above
admitting restriction operations
\[\restn{}:L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}\to L_{2a_n,2a_{n-1},\ldots,2a_2,2a_1+1}\]
defined whenever not all of $a_n,\ldots,a_{2}$ are zero. %The graded part $L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ is assumed to be zero whenever $a_1=0$, and we write $|x|$ as above. 
For $x,y\in L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ and $z\in L$ the restriction operations satisfy \[\restn{(x+y)}=\restn{(x)}+\restn{(y)}+[x,y]\textup{ and }[\restn{x},z]=[x,[x,z]].\]
Note that when $n=1$ the restriction is not defined anywhere.
\end{itemize}
We have defined the bracket and restrictions on homogeneous elements only, but there is no problem extending these operations definition to non-homogeneous elements using the bilinearity of the bracket and the above formula for the restriction of a sum.
%We can define $\restn{}$ on the the direct sum of those $L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ for which not all of $a_n,\ldots,a_2$ are zero, using the above formula for $\restn{(x+y)}$. Then both of the above two formulae will still hold for non-homogeneous $x,y,z$. Thus, we could equally have defined $\PRLie{n}$ by giving a restriction on this entire ideal.
%\begin{prop*}
%If $X\in\GS{n}$ a graded set, the `Hall basis' of $\Fr{\GoodLie{n}}(X)$ \cite{MR0038336} consists of certain `standard monomials' $b$ in the elements of $X$. Then $\Fr{\BadLie{n}}(X)$ has a basis $\{b\}\cup\{[b,b]\}$.
%\end{prop*}

If $X\in\GS{n}$ a graded set, one may choose a `Hall basis' of $\Fr{\GoodLie{n}}(X)$ \cite{MR0038336} consisting of certain `standard monomials' $b$ in the elements of $X$.
\begin{prop*}
Let $X\in\GS{n}$ be a graded set, and let $B$ be a Hall basis for $\Fr{\GoodLie{n}}(X)$ derived from $X$. Note that $B\subset \Fr{\GoodLie{n}}(X)$ is actually a graded set. Then:
\begin{enumerate}[i)]\squishlist
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item $\Fr{\BadLie{n}}(X)$ has a basis $B\cup\{[b,b]\,:\,b\in B\}$;
\item $\Fr{\RestLie{n}}(X)$ has a basis $\{\iteratedrestn{b}{n}\,:\,b\in B,\,n\geq0\}$; and
\item $\Fr{\PRLie{n}}(X)$ has a basis $B\cup \{\iteratedrestn{b}{n}\,:\,b\in B_{a_{n},\ldots,a_1},\,n\geq1,\textup{ not all of $a_n,\ldots,a_2$ are zero}\}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop*}
\begin{proof}
Part (ii) is standard and can be found in \cite[Proposition 14, p.66]{MR886063}.
For part (i), note that the Jacobi identity implies that $[x,[y,y]]$ is identically zero in any bad Lie algebra.
%For part (i), note that in any Lie algebra in characteristic 2, $[x,[y,y]]$ is zero, by anti-symmetry in odd or zero characteristic, and by the Jacobi identity in characteristic 2. 
In particular, the proposed basis must span $\Fr{\BadLie{n}}(X)$. On the other hand, as one easily defines a Lie algebra structure on the vector space spanned by the symbols $B\cup\{[b,b]\}$, they must be linearly independent in $\Fr{\BadLie{n}}(X)$, proving (i).

For (iii), the proposed basis again must span $\Fr{\PRLie{n}}(X)$, and can be seen to be linearly independent by considering the map $\Fr{\PRLie{n}}(X)\to \Fr{\RestLie{n}}(X)$ of partially restricted Lie algebras.
\end{proof}


\subsection*{Homotopy operations for simplicial Lie algebras}
The goal of this section is to determine the natural operations on the homotopy of a simplicial object in the category $\mathsf{C}$, for $\mathsf{C}=\mathsf{C}^n$ any of the above categories of graded Lie algebras. This is equivalent to calculating the homotopy of `wedges of spheres'.

That is, suppose that $X\in\GS{n+1}$ is a graded set. Then one can form a simplicial pointed graded set $S(X)\in s\GpS{n}$ by the formula
\[(S(X))_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}=\bigvee_{x\in X_{d,a_n,\ldots,a_1}}S^d_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}\]
Here, $S^d_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ is the standard simplicial $d$-sphere $\Delta^d/\partial\Delta^n$ living in the $a_n,\ldots,a_1$ grading.
Then $\Fr{\mathsf{C}}S(X)\in s\mathsf{C}$ represents the following functor $s\mathsf{C}\to\AbGp$
\[C\mapsto \prod_{x\in X_{d,a_n,\ldots,a_1}}\pi_d(C)_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}\]
where $\pi_d(C)_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ is the grading $a_n,\ldots,a_1$ part of $\pi_d(C)$. In particular, by Yoneda's lemma:
\[\left\{\prod_{x\in X_{d,a_n,\ldots,a_1}}\pi_d(\DASH)_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}\overset{\textup{nat}}{\to}\pi_D(\DASH)_{A_n,\ldots,A_1}\right\}\cong\pi_D\left(\Fr{\mathsf{C}}S(X)\right)_{A_n,\ldots,A_1}\]
Thus we're interested in the homotopy groups of $\mathsf{C}S(X)$. These are well known when $\mathsf{C}$ is $\GoodLie{n}$ or $\RestLie{n}$, and from these calculations we will deduce the result when $\mathsf{C}=\PRLie{n}$. Before stating the results, we recall certain well known operations on the homotopy of good and restricted Lie algebras, as discussed in \cite[Thm 7.12, Prop 8.8]{CurtisSimplicialHtpy.pdf}:
\begin{prop*}
For $X$ a simplicial object either in $\GoodLie{n}$ or $\RestLie{n}$, $\pi_{*}(X)$ naturally becomes a good Lie algebra (in $\GoodLie{n+1}$) under a bracket induced by the shuffle map. Moreover, $\pi_{*}(X)$ has natural operations
\[\LambdaOp^i:\pi_{a_{n+1}}(X)_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}\to \pi_{a_{n+1}+i}(X)_{2a_n,\ldots,2a_2,2a_1+1}
\]
defined whenever $0<i\leq a_{n+1}$ and when $i=0$ if $X\in\RestLie{n}$. The following relations hold between the various operations (whenever the left hand side of each relation is defined).
%\[\textup{for $i>2j,$\ \ }\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx=\sum_{k=0}^{(i-2j)/2-1}{i-2j-2-k\choose k}\LambdaOp^{2j+1+k}\LambdaOp^{i-j-1-k}x.\]
%\[\LambdaOp^i{(x+y)}=\LambdaOp^i{x}+\LambdaOp^i{y}\textup{ and }[\LambdaOp^i{x},z]=0\textup{ for $i<|x|=|y|$ and any $z$}\]
%\[\LambdaOp^i(x+y)=\LambdaOp^ix+\LambdaOp^iy+[x,y]\textup{ and }[\LambdaOp^{i}x,z]=[x,[x,z]]\textup{ for $i=|x|=|y|$ and any $z$}.\]
The $\LambdaOp$ operations satisfy the $\LambdaOp$-Adem relations:%, so that if $i>2j$, and $\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx$ is defined, then:
\[\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx=\sum_{k=0}^{(i-2j)/2-1}{i-2j-2-k\choose k}\LambdaOp^{2j+1+k}\LambdaOp^{i-j-1-k}x\textup{ for }i>2j.\]
The non-top operations are linear and are killed by the bracket.
That is, for $x,y\in \pi_{a_{n+1}}(X)_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$, $z\in \pi_*(X)$ and $i<a_{n+1}$: \[\LambdaOp^i{(x+y)}=\LambdaOp^i{x}+\LambdaOp^i{y}\textup{ and }[\LambdaOp^i{x},z]=0.\]
On the other hand, the top $\LambdaOp$ operation, 
acts as a (partially defined) restriction, so that, for $x,y\in \pi_i(X)_{ a_{n},\ldots,a_1}$ and $z\in \pi_*(X)$,
\[\LambdaOp^i(x+y)=\LambdaOp^ix+\LambdaOp^iy+[x,y]\textup{ and }[\LambdaOp^{i}x,z]=[x,[x,z]].\]

%
%
%
%
% The top $\LambdaOp^i$ acts as a restriction operation, so that $\LambdaOp^{|x|}(x)=\restn(x)$ whenever both sides are defined. The non-top operations are linear and are killed by the bracket.
%That is, for $x,y\in L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$, $i<a_n$ (with not all of $i,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_{2}$ being zero) and $z\in L$: \[\LambdaOp^i{(x+y)}=\LambdaOp^i{x}+\LambdaOp^i{y}\textup{ and }[\LambdaOp^i{x},z]=0.\]
%Finally, the $\LambdaOp$ operations are assumed to satisfy the following $\LambdaOp$-Adem relations wherever they make sense. If $i>2j$, and $\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx$ is defined (i.e.\ $j\leq|x|$, not all of $j,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_2$ are zero, and $i\leq|x|+j$):
%\[\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx=\sum_{k=0}^{(i-2j)/2-1}{i-2j-2-k\choose k}\LambdaOp^{2j+1+k}\LambdaOp^{i-j-1-k}x.\]
\end{prop*}
\noindent It is not immediately obvious that $\LambdaOp$-Adem relations are well defined --- that when $\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx$ is defined, so is each term on the right hand side. Whenever $\LambdaOp^{i'}\LambdaOp^{j'}x$ appears on the right hand side of this Adem relation, write $(i,j)\produces{\LambdaOp}(i',j')$. 
\begin{lem*}
Suppose that $i>2j$, and $(i,j)\produces{\LambdaOp}(i',j')$. Then
\begin{enumerate}[i)]\squishlist
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item Both $i'$ and $j'$ are nonzero.
\item If $\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^j$ is defined on a class in $\pi_n (L)$ for $L$ a simplicial Lie algebra, then $\LambdaOp^{i'}\LambdaOp^{j'}$ is defined on all of $\pi_{n-1}(L)$.
\end{enumerate}
In particular, if $\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx$ is defined, and $i>2j$, it can be rewritten as a sum of terms $\LambdaOp^{i'}\LambdaOp^{j'}x$ in which neither of the $\LambdaOp^{i'}$ and $\LambdaOp^{j'}$ that appear are top operations.
\end{lem*}
\begin{proof}
By inspection, $i>j+i/2\geq i'\geq2j+1$, and $i-j-1\geq j'\geq i/2>j$. These inequalities demonstrate (i). For (ii), note that (i) shows that we needn't worry about $\LambdaOp^0$ failing to be defined, as it won't appear. Our only concern is that either $i'$ or $j'$ will be too large. Suppose then that $\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^j$ is defined on an $n$-dimensional class, so that $j\leq n$ and $i\leq n+j$. Then one notes that $j'\leq i-j-1\leq n-1$, and $i'-j'\leq (j+i/2)-(i/2)<i/2\leq(n+j)/2\leq n$. The first chain gives $j'\leq n-1$, and the second $i'\leq n-1+j'$, as the quantities involved are integers. These inequalities demonstrate (ii) and the final comment.
\end{proof}
%The $\LambdaOp$-Adem relations above make sense, as they preserve definedness. That is, when $i>2j$ and $\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx$ is defined, all the terms on the right hand side are also defined. To demonstrate this we draw together some observations:
%\[\textup{if $(i,j)\produces{\LambdaOp}(i',j')$, then $i>j+i/2\geq i'\geq2j+1$, and $i-j-1\geq j'\geq i/2>j$.}\]
%Thus, if $\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx$ is defined, so is $\LambdaOp^{i'}\LambdaOp^{j'}x$ --- neither of $i'$ or $j'$ are zero, and one notes that $j'\leq i-j-1<|x|$ and $i'-j'\leq (j+i/2)-(i/2)<i/2\leq(|x|+j)/2\leq |x|$, so that it makes sense to write $\LambdaOp^{j'}x$, and $\LambdaOp^{i'}\LambdaOp^{j'}x$ respectively. In fact, as each of these chains involved a strict inequality, the composite $\LambdaOp^{i'}\LambdaOp^{j'}$ makes sense on \emph{strictly more} degrees than $\LambdaOp^{i}\LambdaOp^{j}$ does. One result of this is that the right hand side of the Adem relation will never involve a top $\LambdaOp$-operation.
With these operations in hand, we can express the homotopy groups of interest as follows:
\begin{prop*}
Suppose that $X\in\GS{n+1}$ is a graded set. Let $B$ be a Hall basis for the free Lie algebra $\Fr{\GoodLie{n+1}}(X)$. Note that $B\subset \Fr{\GoodLie{n}}(X)$ is in particular a graded set.
\begin{enumerate}[i)]\squishlist
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item $\pi_*(\Fr{\GoodLie{n}}S(X))$ has basis $\{\LambdaOp^Ib\,:\,b\in B,\,I\in\admis{\LambdaOp},\ 0<i_\ell\leq|b|\}$;
\item $\pi_*(\Fr{\RestLie{n}}S(X))$ has basis $\{\LambdaOp^Ib\,:\,b\in B,\,I\in\admis{\LambdaOp},\ 0\leq i_\ell\leq|b|\}$; and
\item $\pi_*(\Fr{\PRLie{n}}S(X))$ has basis $\{\LambdaOp^Ix\,:\,b\in B_{a_{n+1},\ldots,a_1},\,I\in\admis{\LambdaOp},\ i_\ell\leq|b|,\ i_\ell,a_{n},\ldots,a_2\textup{ not all zero}\}$.
\end{enumerate}
We always allow $I$ to be the empty sequence in the above bases, in which case the condition on $i_{\ell}$ is to be ignored. If $I$ is nonempty, we write $i_{\ell}$ for the rightmost entry of $I$.
\end{prop*}
The first two parts assert that the natural homotopy operations in the homotopy of a simplicial good or restricted Lie algebra are generated by the operations of the previous proposition, and are subject only to those relations stated. Part (iii) asserts that the natural homotopy operations for partially restricted Lie algebras interpolate between those for good and those for restricted Lie algebras in the obvious way.

Part (iii) demonstrates that $\PiAlg{\PRLie{n}}$, the natural target category for the functor $\pi_*$ on $s\PRLie{n}$, is in fact the category $\LL{n+1}$ that we'll define in the next section.
\begin{proof}[Proof of proposition]
See
\cite[Thm 8.8 and proof]{CurtisSimplicialHtpy.pdf} for the proof of parts (i) and (ii).

For any set $Y\in\GpS{n}$, write $Y^\textup{z}\in\GpS{n}$ for the object defined by
\[(Y^\textup{z})_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}=\begin{cases}
Y_{0,\ldots,0,a_1},&\textup{if }a_n=\cdots =a_2=0;\\
\star,&\textup{otherwise}.
%\\,&\textup{if }
\end{cases}
\]
This assignment is natural in $Y$, and there is a natural surjection $\Fr\RestLie{n}(Y)\to\Fr\RestLie{n}(Y^\textup{z})$ of restricted Lie algebras. The above calculation of bases for the free constructions in $\GoodLie{n}$, $\RestLie{n}$ and $\PRLie{n}$, shows that the kernel of the composite $\Fr\RestLie{n}(Y)\to\Fr\RestLie{n}(Y^\textup{z})\to\Fr\RestLie{n}(Y^\textup{z})/\Fr\GoodLie{n}(Y^\textup{z})$ is precisely $\Fr{\PRLie{n}}(Y)$.

Thus we have short exact sequences of simplicial vector spaces:
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
0
\ar[r]
&%r1c1
\Fr{\PRLie{n}}S(X)
\ar[r]^\gamma
&%r1c2
\Fr{\RestLie{n}}S(X)
\ar[r]^-(.4)\beta&%r1c3
\Fr{\RestLie{n}}S(X)/\Fr{\PRLie{n}}S(X)
\ar[r]
\ar[d]^-{\cong}
&%r1c4
0\\%r1c5
0
\ar[r]
&%r1c1
\Fr{\GoodLie{n}}S(X^\textup{z})
\ar[r]^{\alpha}
&%r1c2
\Fr{\RestLie{n}}S(X^\textup{z})
\ar[r]&%r1c3
\Fr{\RestLie{n}}S(X^\textup{z})/\Fr{\GoodLie{n}}S(X^\textup{z})
\ar[r]
&%r1c4
0
}\]
Now parts (i) and (ii) show that $\alpha_*$ is a monomorphism, so that the LES for the bottom row splits into short exact sequences, and $\beta_*$ maps the subspace of $\pi_*(\Fr{\RestLie{n}}S(X))$ spanned by
\[C=\{\LambdaOp^Ib\in\pi_*(\Fr{\RestLie{n}}S(X))\,:\,b\in B_{0,\ldots,0,a_1},\,I\in\admis{\LambdaOp},\ 0= i_\ell\leq|b|\}\]
isomorphically onto the homotopy of the final term. This shows that the LES for the top row splits. Finally, we can construct classes 
\[D=\{\LambdaOp^Ix\in\pi_*(\Fr{\PRLie{n}}S(X))\,:\,b\in B_{a_{n+1},\ldots,a_1},\,I\in\admis{\LambdaOp},\ i_\ell\leq|b|,\ i_\ell,a_{n},\ldots,a_2\textup{ not all zero}\}\]
in $\pi_*(\Fr{\PRLie{n}}S(X))$ using the same formulae as in $\pi_*(\Fr{\RestLie{n}}S(X))$. Thus $\gamma(D)$ and $C$ together form the basis of $\pi_*(\Fr{\RestLie{n}}S(X))$ given in part (ii), and $D$ must be a basis for $\pi_*(\Fr{\PRLie{n}}S(X))$.

\end{proof}



%Then \cite[Thm 8.6, Thm 8.8]{CurtisSimplicialHtpy.pdf} shows that $\pi_*(\Fr{\RestLie{n}}(V))$ is an element of $\LL{n}$, and has a basis consisting of tensors $\LambdaOp^{I}\otimes b$, for $b\in B$, and $I\in\admis{\LambdaOp}$ with $i_\ell\leq|b|$.




\subsection*{Categories of graded Lie algebras with unstable operations}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
%\item Let $\LL{1}$ be the full subcategory of connected objects in $\calW$. We already have the definition for these in Goerss' book, but I'll spell this out here, to emphasise certain interesting aspects of the character of $\LL{1}$.
%An object of $\LL{1}$ is a (potentially bad) graded Lie algebra $L$ in $\BadLie{1}$ with an unstable (linear) action of $\Palgebra$.
%That is, $L$ admits $P$ operations
%\[P^i:L_{a_1}\to L_{a_1+i+1}\]
%which are \emph{always} defined for $i\geq0$, but \emph{equal zero} unless $2\leq i\leq a_n$.
%%By `bad' Lie algebra, we mean that the bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity, and is skew symmetric (``$[x,y]=[y,x]$ for all $x,y$'').
%%The graded part $L_{0}$ is assumed to be zero, and for $x\in L_{a_1}$ we write $|x|:=a_1$. 
%The $P$ operations are assumed to satisfy the following $P$-Adem relations. If $i\geq 2j$:
%\[P^iP^jx=\sum_{s=i-j+1}^{i+j-2}{2s-i-1\choose s-j}P^{i+j-s}P^sx.\]
%Every $P$ operation is assumed linear, and $[x,P^iy]=0$ for all $i,x,y$. Additionally, the top $P$ operation is the `self-square': for $x\in L_{i}$, $P^{i}x=[x,x]$.
\item Let $\LL{1}$ be the following category of graded bad Lie algebras which are also unstable left $\LambdaOp$-modules.
An object of $\LL{1}$ is a (potentially) bad graded Lie algebra $L$ in $\BadLie{1}$ %with an unstable (linear) action of $\Palgebra$.
admitting linear operations
\[P^i:L_{a_1}\to L_{a_1+i+1}\]
which are \emph{always} defined for $i\geq0$, but \emph{equal zero} unless $2\leq i\leq a_n$. They satisfy the $P$-Adem operations when written on the left. Finally, $[x,P^iy]=0$ for all $i,x,y$, and the top $P$ operation is the `self-square': for $x\in L_{i}$, $P^{i}x=[x,x]$.

Note that this is just the full subcategory of connected objects in Goerss' category $\calW$. See \cite[p.14]{MR1089001}.

\item Let $\nontop{1}$ be the following category of graded unstable $P$-modules. An object of $\nontop{1}$ is a graded vector space $M$ in $\GR{1}$,
admitting linear operations
\[P^i:M_{a_1}\to M_{a_1+i+1}\]
which are always defined, but are zero unless $2\leq i\leq a_n$.
%The graded part $M_{0}$ is assumed to be zero, and for $x\in M_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ we write $|x|:=a_n$. 
The $P$ operations are assumed to satisfy the same $P$-Adem relations as in $\LL{1}$. %Every operation $P^i$ is assumed linear.
\item For $n\geq2$, let $\LL{n}$ be the following category of $n$-graded partially restricted Lie algebras with unstable $\LambdaOp$ operators acting from the left. An object of $\LL{n}$ consists of an object $L$ of $\PRLie{n}$ 
admitting $\LambdaOp$ operations
\[\LambdaOp^i:L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}\to L_{a_n+i,2a_{n-1},\ldots,2a_2,2a_1+1}\]
defined whenever $i\leq a_n$ and not all of $i,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_{2}$ are zero. The top $\LambdaOp^i$ \emph{equals} the restriction operation, so that $\LambdaOp^{|x|}(x)=\restn(x)$ whenever both sides are defined. The non-top operations are linear and are killed by the bracket.
That is, for $x,y\in L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$, $i<a_n$ (with not all of $i,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_{2}$ being zero) and $z\in L$: \[\LambdaOp^i{(x+y)}=\LambdaOp^i{x}+\LambdaOp^i{y}\textup{ and }[\LambdaOp^i{x},z]=0.\]
Finally, the $\LambdaOp$ operations are assumed to satisfy the following $\LambdaOp$-Adem relations wherever they make sense. If $i>2j$, and $\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx$ is defined (i.e.\ $j\leq|x|$, not all of $j,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_2$ are zero, and $i\leq|x|+j$):
\[\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx=\sum_{k=0}^{(i-2j)/2-1}{i-2j-2-k\choose k}\LambdaOp^{2j+1+k}\LambdaOp^{i-j-1-k}x.\]
%\item For $n\geq2$, let $\LL{n}$ be the following category of $n$-graded \emph{good} Lie algebras with unstable $\LambdaOp$ operators acting from the left. An object of $\LL{n}$ consists of an object $L$ of $\GoodLie{n}$
%%, under a $(0,\ldots,0,1)$-shifted bracket:
%%\[[\DASH,\DASH]:L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}\otimes L_{b_n,\ldots,b_1}\to L_{a_n+b_n,\ldots,a_2+b_2,a_1+b_1+1}\]
%admitting $\LambdaOp$ operations
%\[\LambdaOp^i:L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}\to L_{a_n+i,2a_{n-1},\ldots,2a_2,2a_1+1}\]
%defined whenever $i\leq a_n$ and not all of $i,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_{2}$ are zero. %By `good' Lie algebra, we mean that the bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity, and is alternating (``$[x,x]=0$ for all $x$'').
%%The graded part $L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ is assumed to be zero whenever $a_1=0$, and for $x\in L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ we write $|x|:=a_n$.
%The $\LambdaOp$ operations are assumed to satisfy the following $\LambdaOp$-Adem relations wherever they make sense. If $i>2j$, and $\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx$ is defined (i.e.\ $j\leq|x|$, not all of $j,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_2$ are zero, and $i\leq|x|+j$):
%\[\LambdaOp^i\LambdaOp^jx=\sum_{k=0}^{(i-2j)/2-1}{i-2j-2-k\choose k}\LambdaOp^{2j+1+k}\LambdaOp^{i-j-1-k}x.\]
%The non-top operations are linear and are killed by the bracket.
%That is, for $x,y\in L_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ and $z\in L$: \[\LambdaOp^i{(x+y)}=\LambdaOp^i{x}+\LambdaOp^i{y}\textup{ and }[\LambdaOp^i{x},z]=0.\]
%On the other hand, the top operation, 
%\[\LambdaOp^i:L_{i, a_{n-1},\ldots,a_1}\to L_{2i, 2a_{n-1},\ldots,2a_2,2a_1+1}\]
%acts as a partially defined restriction for $L$, satsfying, for $x,y\in L_{i, a_{n-1},\ldots,a_1}$ and $z\in L$,
%\[\LambdaOp^i(x+y)=\LambdaOp^ix+\LambdaOp^iy+[x,y]\textup{ and }[\LambdaOp^{i}x,z]=[x,[x,z]].\]

\item For $n\geq2$, let $\nontop{n}$ be the following category of $n$-graded vector spaces with unstable $\LambdaOp$ operators acting from the left. An object of $\nontop{n}$ is an $n$-graded vector space $M$ in $\GR{n}$,
admitting linear operations
\[\LambdaOp^i:M_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}\to M_{a_n+i,2a_{n-1},\ldots,2a_2,2a_1+1}\]
defined whenever $i< a_n$ (note the strict inequality) and not all of $i,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_{2}$ are zero.
%The graded part $M_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ is assumed to be zero whenever $a_1=0$, and for $x\in M_{a_n,\ldots,a_1}$ we write $|x|:=a_n$. 
The $\LambdaOp$ operations are assumed to satisfy the same $\LambdaOp$-Adem relations as in $\LL{n}$, wherever they make sense in $\nontop{n}$. %The same discussion shows that this too is a meaningful definition. %Every operation $\LambdaOp^i$ is assumed linear.

Let $X\in\GS{n}$ be a graded set, and let $B$ be a Hall basis for $\Fr{\GoodLie{n}}(X)$ derived from $X$. Note that $B\subset \Fr{\GoodLie{n}}(X)$ is in particular a graded set. Then when $n=1$:

\item[iv)] $\Fr{\nontop{n}}(X)$ has basis $\{\LambdaOp^Ix\,:\,x\in X_{a_{n},\ldots,a_1},\,I\in\admis{\LambdaOp},\ i_\ell<|b|,\ i_\ell,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_2\textup{ not all zero}\}$.
\end{enumerate}
We always allow $I$ to be the empty sequence in the above bases.
\end{prop*}
%\begin{prop*}
%For $n\geq2$, for $X\in\GS{n}$ a graded set, $\Fr{\LL{n}}(X)$ has basis the compositions $\LambdaOp^{I}b$, where $b$ runs over a homogeneous Hall basis for the free (unrestricted, good) Lie algebra $\Fr{\GoodLie{n}}(X)$, and $I=(i_1,\ldots,i_\ell)$ is a $\LambdaOp$-admissible sequence with $i_\ell\leq|b|$ and not all of $i_{\ell},a_{n-1},\ldots,a_2$ are zero if $b$ has grading $(a_n,\ldots,a_1)$.

%$\Fr{\nontop{n}}(X)$ has basis the compositions $\LambdaOp^{I}x$ where $x\in X$ and $I=(i_1,\ldots,i_\ell)$ is a $\LambdaOp$-admissible sequence with $i_\ell<|x|$ and not all of $i_{\ell},a_{n-1},\ldots,a_2$ are zero if $x$ has grading $(a_n,\ldots,a_1)$.
%%Here, $L^uX$ is an object of $\GoodLie{n}$ if we stipulate that the bracket shifts degrees as appropriate.
%\end{prop*}
\begin{proof}
Part (i) is \cite[Thm F, p.15]{MR1089001}.
In each of the remaining three cases, it is clear that the proposed bases span the free constructions. It remains to show that the elements are linearly independent.
The proposed basis in part (ii) is seen to be linearly independent using the map $\Fr{\nontop{1}}(X)\to \Fr{\LL{1}}(X)$. Part (iv) follows from (iii) similarly.

For part (iii), note that we have calculated the object $\pi_*(\Fr{\PRLie{n-1}}S(X))\in\PiAlg{\PRLie{n-1}}=\LL{n}$, and that the elements of our proposed basis of $\Fr{\LL{n}}(X)$ map to a basis of $\pi_*(\Fr{\PRLie{n-1}}S(X))$ under the natural map. This proves the linear independence statement we require.
%For part (iii), choose a simplicial object of $\GR{n-1}$, say $V\in s(\GR{n-1})$, such that $\pi_{*}V=\Fr{\GR{n}}(X)$. Then \cite[Thm 8.6, Thm 8.8]{CurtisSimplicialHtpy.pdf} shows that $\pi_*(\Fr{\RestLie{n}}(V))$ is an element of $\LL{n}$, and has a basis consisting of tensors $\LambdaOp^{I}\otimes b$, for $b\in B$, and $I\in\admis{\LambdaOp}$ with $i_\ell\leq|b|$. The `not all zero' condition is dropped here, so that $\pi_*(\Fr{\RestLie{n}}(V))$ is larger than our proposed $\LL{n}(X)$.
%
%Consider then the morphism $\Fr{\LL{n}}(X)\to \pi_*(\Fr{\RestLie{n}}(V))$ induced by the universal property of the free construction. The images of the proposed basis for $\Fr{\LL{n}}(X)$ map to linearly independent elements in $\pi_*(\Fr{\RestLie{n}}(V))$, showing that $\Fr{\LL{n}}(X)$ is as described. The same argument will prove (iv), this time viewing $\pi_*(\Fr{\RestLie{n}}(V))$ as an element of $\nontop{n}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{cor*}
For all $n\geq 1$, the forgetful functor $\forget:\LL{n}\to\nontop{n}$ preserves free objects.
\end{cor*}
\begin{proof}
When $n=1$, $\Fr{\LL{1}}(X)$ is free on $B$ as an object of $\nontop{n}$. For $n\geq2$, $\Fr{\LL{n}}(X)$  is free on $B\cup \{\iteratedrestn{b}{n}\,:\,b\in B_{a_{n},\ldots,a_1},\,n\geq1,\textup{ not all of $a_n,\ldots,a_2$ are zero}\}$ as an object of $\nontop{n}$, since
\[\iteratedrestn{b}{n}=\LambdaOp^{(2^{n-1}|b|)}\LambdaOp^{(2^{n-2}|b|)}\cdots \LambdaOp^{|b|}b.\qedhere\]

\begin{DiagramOfFunctors}
\section*{A diagram of functors}
Now for each category $\mathsf{C}$ amongst $\LL{n}$, $\PRLie{n}$ and $\nontop{n}$, there is a functor $\Ind{\mathsf{C}}:\mathsf{C\overset{}{\to}\GR{n}}$, which takes the quotient of the underlying vector space by the subspace spanned by the image of all of the structure maps. These provide the solid horizontal arrows in the following diagram, while the vertical maps are the evident forgetful functors: %There are also free/forget adjunctions $\GS{n} \rightleftarrows \mathsf{C}$. %Finally, there's a forgetful functor $\forget:\LL{n}\to\nontop{n}$, which, importantly, preserves  free objects%footnote:
%\footnote{I think that the adjunction does need to come from graded pointed sets, but that that's no problem for Blanc-Stover. The only thing that matters is that $\forget$ preserves frees, but it does --- frees in $\nontop{n}$ are easy to describe.}. These functors give the solid maps in the following diagram:
\[\xymatrix@R=8mm@C=15mm@!C{

}\]
\begin{prop*}
For all $n\geq1$ there exists a functor $\LL{n}\to\PRLie{n}$ which preserves free objects, and completing the diagram above to a commuting square and triangle.
\end{prop*}
\begin{proof}
For all $n$, the bracket and restrictions that are required to define an object of $\nontop{n}$ are well defined after quotienting out the image of the operations in $\Ind{\nontop{n}}$.

When $n=1$ we are to quotient by the image of all of the $P$ operations. There are no restriction operations to be defined, and the bracket is well defined due to the axiom ``$[x,P^iy]=0$''. Although we started with a bad Lie algebra, the axiom ``$P^{|x|}x=[x,x]$'' shows that the quotient is a good lie algebra, as required.

When $n\geq2$  we are to quotient by the image of all of the non-top $\LambdaOp$ operations. Again, the bracket is well defined on the quotient as brackets kill non-top $\LambdaOp$ operations. To see that the restriction is well defined on the quotient, %we must check the following fact: for homogeneous $x,y\in L$, and $0\leq i<|y|$ such that $\LambdaOp^iy$ is defined and $i+|y|=|x|$, $\restn{(x)}$ and $\restn(x+\LambdaOp^iy)$ differ by a sum of images of nontop $\LambdaOp$ operations. This follows from the fact that $\LambdaOp$-Adem relations do not produce top $\LambdaOp$ operations, since \[\restn{(x+\LambdaOp^iy)}=\restn{(x)}+\restn{(\LambdaOp^iy)}+[x,\LambdaOp^iy]=\restn{(x)}+\LambdaOp^{|y|+i}\LambdaOp^iy+0,\] and $|x|=i+|y|>2i$, so that there's an Adem relation to apply to $\LambdaOp^{|x|}\LambdaOp^iy$.
suppose that $\LambdaOp^iy$ is the image of a well-defined non-top operation, so that $i<|y|$. Then
\[\restn{(x+\LambdaOp^iy)}=\restn{(x)}+\restn{(\LambdaOp^iy)}+[x,\LambdaOp^iy]=\restn{(x)}+\LambdaOp^{|y|+i}\LambdaOp^iy.\]
The rightmost term admits the application of an Adem relation, as $|y|+i>2i$, but we have seen that Adem relations never return top $\LambdaOp$ operations.

These arguments have shown that the quotient supports the structure of partially restricted Lie algebra. The assignment is clearly functorial, and makes the whole diagram commute. 
By examining our results on the bases of the various free constructions, one sees that $\Ind{\nontop{n}}$ sends $\Fr{\LL{n}}(X)$ to $\Fr{\PRLie{n}}(X)$, both when $n=1$ and when $n\geq2$.
\end{proof}
\noindent It should cause no confusion when we denote the functor of this proposition $\Ind{\nontop{n}}:\LL{n}\to \PRLie{n}$ as well, giving a commuting diagram
\[\xymatrix@R=8mm@C=15mm@!C{

}\]
in which the functors $\forget$ and $\Ind{\nontop{n}}$ with domain $\LL{n}$ both preserve free objects.
%The point is that there is a functor $\LL{n}\to\PRLie{n}$ which completes this diagram to a commuting square and triangle, which we also name $\Ind{\nontop{n}}$. It will be important to note that $\Ind{\nontop{n}}$ sends free objects in $\LL{n}$ to free objects in $\PRLie{n}$.
%
%When $n=1$, $\Ind{\nontop{n}}$ quotients the underlying vector space by the images of all of the $P$ operations. The result inherits the structure of an element of $\PRLie{n}$ from the bracket in $\LL{1}$. This is well defined due to the axioms ``$[x,P^iy]=0$'' and ``$P^{|x|}x=[x,x]$''. 
%
%When $n\geq2$, $\Ind{\nontop{n}}$ quotients the underlying vector space by the images of all of the non-top $\LambdaOp$ operations. That is, by the span of the $\LambdaOp^ix$ for $i<|x|$. The result inherits the structure of an element of $\PRLie{n}$ as follows. The Lie bracket is induced by that in $\LL{n}$; well defined by the axiom ``$[\LambdaOp^i{x},z]=0$ for $i<|x|$''. The restriction is induced by the top $\LambdaOp$ operations, being defined by the formula $\restn{x}:=\LambdaOp^{|x|}x$. It is a little less obvious that this is in fact well defined. One must check, for homogeneous $x,y\in L$, and $0\leq i<|y|$ such that $\LambdaOp^iy$ is defined and $i+|y|=|x|$, that $\LambdaOp^{|x|}x$ and $\LambdaOp^{|x|}(x+\LambdaOp^iy)$ differ by a sum of images of non-top $\LambdaOp$ operations. But\[\LambdaOp^{|x|}(x+\LambdaOp^iy)-\LambdaOp^{|x|}x=\LambdaOp^{|x|}(\LambdaOp^iy)+[x,\LambdaOp^iy]=\LambdaOp^{|x|}\LambdaOp^iy,\]and the above calcuation regarding indices in the $\LambdaOp$-Adem relations shows that $\LambdaOp^{|x|}\LambdaOp^iy$ can be rewritten without the appearance of a top $\LambdaOp$.
\end{DiagramOfFunctors}
\begin{GrothendieckSpectralSequences}
\section*{Grothendieck spectral sequences}
We are interested in the derived functors $(\derived\Ind{\LL{n}})X\in\GR{n+1}$ for $X\in\LL{n}$. It is convenient for us to omit the customary asterisk in $\derived_*$, and to think of the derived functors as a single object with a one more grading than $X$ has. We always write the new grading to the left of the previous gradings, as is customary. To study $(\derived\Ind{\LL{n}})(X)$ we use the Grothendieck spectral sequence derived in \cite{Blanc_Stover-Groth_SS.pdf}. The spectral sequence takes the form:
\[E^2_{st}=(\derived_s(\overline{\Ind{\PRLie{n}}}_t))(\derived\Ind{\nontop{n}})X\implies(\derived_{s+t}\Ind{\LL{n}})X\textup{ with }d^{r}:E_{st}\to E_{s-r,t+r-1}.\]
To explain this, note that $\derived\Ind{\nontop{n}}\in\PiAlg{\PRLie{n}}$, and $\overline{\Ind{\PRLie{n}}}$ is the functor $\PiAlg{\PRLie{n}}\to\GR{n+1}$ induced by $\Ind{\PRLie{n}}$. The $t$ subscript picks out the part with (new) grading $t$. It might be simpler to write:
\[E^2=(\derived\overline{\Ind{\PRLie{n}}})(\derived\Ind{\nontop{n}})X\implies(\derived\Ind{\LL{n}})X\textup{ with }\deg(d^r)=(-r,r-1,0,\ldots,0).\]
Here, each $E^r$ is $(n+2)$-graded, while $(\derived\Ind{\LL{n}})X$ is $(n+1)$-graded. Each page $E^r$ has two homological degrees in addition to the $n$ internal degrees of $X$, and these extra two degrees on $E^\infty$ sum to the single homological degree in $(\derived\Ind{\LL{n}})X$.
\begin{prop*}
There's a commuting diagram of functors:
\[\xymatrix@R=0mm@C=14mm{
\PiAlg{\PRLie{n}}
\ar[dr]^-{\overline{\Ind{\PRLie{n}}}}
\ar[dd]_-{\cong}
&%r1c1

\GR{n+1}\\%r2c2
\LL{n+1}
\ar[ur]_-{\Ind{\LL{n+1}}}
&%r3c1
%r3c2
}\]
%Under the isomorphism $\PiAlg{\PRLie{n}}\cong\LL{n+1}$, the functor $\overline{\Ind{\PRLie{n}}}:\PiAlg{\PRLie{n}}\to \GR{n+1}$ is identified with 
\end{prop*}
\begin{proof}
As $\overline{\Ind{\PRLie{n}}}$ is a $0^\textup{th}$ left derived functor, and $\Ind{\LL{n+1}}$ preserves colimits, it is enough to check that this diagram commutes on free objects in $\PiAlg{\PRLie{n}}$. All such objects are of the form $\pi_*(\Fr{\PRLie{n}}SX)$ for some $X\in\GS{n+1}$, and
\[\overline{\Ind{\PRLie{n}}}(\pi_*(\Fr{\PRLie{n}}SX)):=\pi_*(\Ind{\PRLie{n}}(\Fr{\PRLie{n}}SX))=\pi_*(SX)=X=\Ind{\LL{n+1}}(\pi_*(\Fr{\PRLie{n}}SX)).\qedhere\]
%The functor $\overline{\Ind{\PRLie{n}}}$ is the $0^\textup{th}$ left derived functor of the functor $\textup{free}(\PiAlg{\PRLie{n}})\to\GR{n+1}$ defined by $\pi_*(\Fr{\PRLie{n}}SX)\mapsto \pi_*(\Ind{\PRLie{n}}(\Fr{\PRLie{n}}SX))$ for $X\in\GS{n+1}$. One calculates $\pi_*(\Ind{\PRLie{n}}(\Fr{\PRLie{n}}SX))=\pi_*(SX)=X$
\end{proof}
%Finally, we should recall that $\PiAlg{\PRLie{n}}\simeq\LL{n+1}$, and under this isomorphism, $\overline{\Ind{\PRLie{n}}}$ is identified with $\Ind{\LL{n+1}}$. 
\begin{cor*}
For $n\geq1$, and any $X\in\LL{n}$, there is a spectral sequence:
\[E^2=(\derived{\Ind{\LL{n+1}}})(\derived\Ind{\nontop{n}})X\implies(\derived\Ind{\LL{n}})X.\]
\begin{itemise}
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item For $r\leq\infty$, the $E^r$ page is an object of $\GR{n+2}$.
\item For $r<\infty$, $d^r:E^r\to E^r$ has degree $(-r,r-1,0,\ldots,0)$.
\item The target, $(\derived\Ind{\LL{n}})X$, is an object of $\GR{n+1}$.
\item There is an increasing filtration $F$ on $(\derived\Ind{\LL{n}})X$ such that
\[E^\infty_{a_{n+2},\ldots,a_1}=(F_{a_{n+2}}/F_{a_{n+2}-1})((\derived\Ind{\LL{n}})X)_{a_{n+2}+a_{n+1},a_n,\ldots,a_1}.\]
\end{itemise}
%The pages $E^r$ ($r\leq\infty$) are $(n+2)$-graded, with $\deg(d^r)=(-r,r-1,0,\ldots,0)$. The term $E^\infty_{a_{n+2},\ldots,a_1}$ is a subquotient of the degree $(a_{n+2}+a_{n+1},a_n,\ldots,a_1)$ part of the target.
\end{cor*}
%Thus, we may write the spectral sequence as:
%\[\fbox{$E^2=(\derived{\Ind{\LL{n+1}}})(\derived\Ind{\nontop{n}})X\implies(\derived\Ind{\LL{n}})X.$}\]
The following observation explains why there's little danger in having two functors named $\Ind{\nontop{n}}$.
\begin{lem*}
For $n\geq1$, and any $X\in\LL{n}$,
\[(\derived{\Ind{\nontop{n}}})X\cong(\derived{\Ind{\nontop{n}}})(\forget(X))\textup{ as a vector space.}\]
That is, as vector spaces, both $(\Ind{\nontop{n}})X$ and $(\derived{\Ind{\nontop{n}}})X$ are unambiguous.
\end{lem*}
\begin{proof}
As $\forget:\LL{n}\to\nontop{n}$ preserves free objects and weak equivalences, there's a one-line Grothendieck spectral sequence proving the result.
\end{proof}

\item $\Z^n:=\{\textbf{z}=(z_1,\ldots,z_n);\ z_i\in\Z\}$
\item $r_i:\Z^n\to\Z^n$ given by $(z_1,\ldots,z_n)\mapsto(z_1,\ldots,z_i-1,\ldots,z_n)$
\item $r_{ij}:=r_i\circ r_j:\Z^n\to\Z^n$
\item $\sigma:\Z^n\to\Z$ given by summing entries
\item for $\textbf{z}\in\Z^n$ write $\calP(\textbf{z})$ for the set of permutations of the multiset $\{i^{z_i};i=1,\ldots,n\}$, written as sequences $\textbf{p}=(p_1,\ldots,p_{\sigma \textbf{z}})$. This set is empty if $\textbf{z}$ has a negative entry. For such a $\textbf{p}$, write $p\sigma_i$ for $(p_1,\ldots,p_{i-1},p_{i+1},p_{i},p_{i+2},\ldots,p_{\sigma \textbf{z}})$.
\item $d_k:\calP(\textbf{z})\to\calP((r_{p_kp_{k+1}}\textbf{z})*(1))$ (the star denotes concatenation), in which $(p_1,\ldots,p_{\sigma \textbf{z}})$ is sent to $(p_1,\ldots,p_{k-1},\ell(\textbf{z})+1,p_{k+2},\ldots,p_{\sigma \textbf{z}})$. That is, two entries are removed, and in their position we place a single entry, $\ell(\textbf{z})+1$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{prop*}
Choose $\textbf{z}\in\Z^n$, and $i$ satisfying $1\leq i\leq n$. Then as $k$ ranges from $1$ to $\sigma \textbf{z}-1$, and $\textbf{p}$ ranges through those elements of $\calP(\textbf{z})$ satisfying $(p_k,p_{k+1})=(i,i)$, then $d_kp$ assumes each value in $\calP((r_{ii}\textbf{z})*(1))$ exactly once.
\end{prop*}
\begin{prop*}
Choose $\textbf{z}\in\Z^n$, and $i\neq j$ satisfying $1\leq i,j\leq n$. Then as $k$ ranges from $1$ to $\sigma \textbf{z}-1$, and $\textbf{p}$ ranges through those elements of $\calP(\textbf{z})$ satisfying $(p_k,p_{k+1})=(i,j)$, then $d_k\textbf{p}$ assumes each value in $\calP((r_{ij}\textbf{z})*(1))$ exactly once. This occurs symmetrically in $i$ and $j$, which is to say that for such a pair $(k,\textbf{p})$, the pair $(k,\textbf{p}\sigma_k)$ works with $i$ and $j$ swapped, and we have $d_k(\textbf{p}\sigma_k)=d_k(\textbf{p})$.
\end{prop*}

\subsection*{The Koszul complex}
The PBW theorem states that $E^0VL=A(L^u)\otimes E(L^r)$, and the homology of this algebra (see Priddy) is thus $E(L^u)\otimes \Gamma(L^r)$. (I think) we'll think of this as the sub-coalgebra of $\Gamma(L)$ in which there are no $\gamma_i$ for $i>1$ applied to unrestrictable elements. It's the shuffle product that produces representatives in $\overline{B}(E^0V(L))$ --- we may send a product $\prod_{i=1}^{n}\gamma_{z_i}(x_i)$ to $\left\langle \textbf{z},\textbf{x}\right\rangle$, a quantity we now define:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item $(hL)^n:=\{\textbf{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n);\ x_i\textup{ homogeneous in }V(L)\}$
%\item $d_{ij}:(hL)^n\to(hL)^{n+1}$ given by $\textbf{x}\mapsto\textbf{x}*(x_ix_j)$
%\item $b_{ij}:(hL)^n\to(hL)^{n+1}$ given by $\textbf{x}\mapsto\textbf{x}*([x_i,x_j])$
\item Choose $\textbf{x}\in(hL)^n$, $\textbf{z}\in\Z^n$ and $\textbf{p}\in\calP(\textbf{z}).$ Then define $\left\langle \textbf{p},\textbf{x}\right\rangle\in\overline{B}_{\sigma\textbf{z},*}(E^0V(L))$ to be the bar $[x_{p_1},\ldots,x_{p_{\sigma\textbf{z}}}]$. Then define $\left\langle \textbf{z},\textbf{x}\right\rangle:= \sum_{\textbf{p}\in\calP(\textbf{z})}\left\langle \textbf{p},\textbf{x}\right\rangle$. 
\end{itemize}
Now $\overline{K}_*(V(L)):=H_{*=*}(E^0V(L))$ is spanned by the bars $\left\langle \textbf{z},\textbf{x}\right\rangle$ where each $x_i$ is a homogeneous element of $L$, which must be restrictable if $z_i>1$ (here, $\sigma\textbf{z}$ is the homological degree). In fact, there's a basis consisting of the $\left\langle \textbf{z},\textbf{x}\right\rangle$ where $\textbf{x}$ runs over (strictly) increasing sequences of elements of an ordered basis chosen for $L$, and the same restrictability condition holds.

Finally we may calculate the differential on $\overline{K}_*(V(L))$. Here goes:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
d\left\langle \textbf{z},\textbf{x}\right\rangle
&=
\sum_{k=1}^{\sigma\textbf{z}-1} \sum_{\textbf{p}\in\calP(\textbf{z})}d_k\left\langle \textbf{p},\textbf{x}\right\rangle%
\\
%&=
%\sum_{k}\sum_{\textbf{p}}\left\langle d_k\textbf{p},d_{p_kp_{k+1}}\textbf{x}\right\rangle%
%\\
&=
\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\sum_{k}\sum_{\textbf{p}:{p_k=i\atop p_{k+1}=j}}\left\langle d_k\textbf{p},\textbf{x}*(x_{p_k}x_{p_{k+1}})\right\rangle%
\\
&=
\sum_{i}\sum_{k}\sum_{\textbf{p}:{p_k=i\atop p_{k+1}=i}}\left\langle d_k\textbf{p},\textbf{x}*(x_ix_i)\right\rangle+\sum_{i<j} \sum_{k}\sum_{\textbf{p}:{p_k=i\atop p_{k+1}=j}}\left\langle d_k\textbf{p},\textbf{x}*(x_ix_j+x_jx_i)\right\rangle%
\\
&=
\sum_{i}\sum_{k}\sum_{\textbf{p}:{p_k=i\atop p_{k+1}=i}}\left\langle d_k\textbf{p},\textbf{x}*\left(\restn{(x_i)}\right)\right\rangle+ \sum_{i<j}\sum_{k}\sum_{\textbf{p}:{p_k=i\atop p_{k+1}=j}}\left\langle d_k\textbf{p},\textbf{x}*\left([x_i,x_j]\right)\right\rangle%
\\
&=
\sum_{i}\sum_{\textbf{q}\in\calP((r_{ii}\textbf{z})*(1))}\left\langle \textbf{q},\textbf{x}*\left(\restn{(x_i)}\right)\right\rangle+\sum_{i<j} \sum_{\textbf{q}\in\calP((r_{ij}\textbf{z})*(1))}\left\langle \textbf{q},\textbf{x}*\left([x_i,x_j]\right)\right\rangle%
\\

\sum_{i}\left\langle (r_{ii}\textbf{z})*(1),\textbf{x}*\left(\restn{(x_i)}\right)\right\rangle+\sum_{i<j} \left\langle (r_{ij}\textbf{z})*(1),\textbf{x}*\left([x_i,x_j]\right)\right\rangle%
% Comment
\end{alignat*}
This is the obvious restriction of May's $\overline{X}$, see page 141 of ``The cohomology of restricted Lie algebras and of Hopf algebras'' (J.\ Alg.\ 3). We use the subspace with fewer $\gamma_i$, and the differential he gives makes sense on and preserves this subspace, and coincides with that here.

He writes the differential on $f=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\gamma_{z_i}(y_i)$ as
\[d(f)=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_iy_i\right)+ \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i,i}\gamma_1(\restn{(y_i)})+\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n}f_{i,j}\gamma_1([y_i,y_j]).\]
Here, the parenthetical term vanishes in $\overline{K}$ --- it's there in case we're using nontrivial coefficients.
