\subsection{Preliminaries on Spectra}
\begin{defn}[objects of $\scrS$]\hfil
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(a)]A spectrum is a sequence of pointed CW-complexes $E_n$ and pointed
CW-inclusions $s_n:SE_n\to E_{n+1}$.
\itm[(b)]A subspectrum is a sequence of sub-CW-complexes $E'_n$ such that $s_n$
maps $SE'_n$ into $E'_{n+1}$.
\itm[(c)]A filtration of $E$ is a sequence 
$\cdots\subset E(i)\subset E(i+1)\subset\cdots$ of subspectra such that the
union (levelwise) of the $E(i)$ equals $E$
\itm[(d)]$(\Sigma^kE)_n:=E_{k+n}$.
\itm[(e)]$(\Sigma^\infty X)_n:=S^nX$ if $n\geq0$, and $*$ is $n<0$.
\end{itemise}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[cells, skeleta, \ldots]\hfil
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(a)]
A cell of $E$ is $\{e,Se,S^2e,\ldots\}$, where $e$ is a $d$-cell of $E_n$ which
is not a suspension of a cell of $E_{n-1}$. It then has dimension $d-n$.
\itm[(b)]A subspectrum $E'\subset E$ is cofinal if all cells of $E$ are
eventually in $E'$.
\itm[(c)]The $n$-skeleton $E^{(n)}$ consists of all cells of dimension at most
$n$.
\itm[(d)]$E$ is finite if it has finitely many cells.
\itm[(e)]$E$ is of finite type if it has finitely many cells in each dimension.
\itm[(f)]$E$ is finite dimensional if $E=E^{(n)}$ for some $n$.
\itm[(g)]$E$ is a suspension spectrum if it equals $\Sigma^k\Sigma^\infty X$.
\end{itemise}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[morphisms in $\scrS$]\hfil
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(a)]A map of spectra is just a family of compatible pointed cellular maps.
\itm[(b)]A morphism of spectra $E\to F$ is an equivalence class of maps out of
cofinal subspectra $E'$. Two such maps are equivalent if they agree on some
subspectrum of the (levelwise) intersection $E'\cap E''$ which is cofinal in
$E$.
\end{itemise}
\end{defn}
Given a spectrum $E$ there are maps $S^kE_n\to E_{n+k}$ by composition. For any
$n$, there is a map $i_n:\Sigma^{-n}\Sigma^\infty E_n\to E$, as the proposed
domain $(n+k)\fourth$ space $S^kE_n$ (when $k\geq0$). Thus $i_n$ is the
inclusion of a subspectrum.
\setcounter{thm}{4}
\begin{prop}\hfil
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(i)] For any fixed $k$, the map $s_n$ sends $S((E_n)^{(n+k)})$ into
$(E_{n+1})^{(n+k+1)}$, as the maps $s_n$ are cellular. Thus $\{E_n^{n+k}\}$ is a
subspectrum of $E^{(k)}$. This subspectrum is in fact cofinal in $E^{(k)}$.
\itm[(ii)]If $E$ is finite, the spaces $E_n$ are all finite.
\itm[(iii)]If $E$ is finite, there exists $N$ such that 
$\Sigma^{-N}\Sigma^\infty E_N$ is cofinal in $E$.
\itm[NB:]Note also that if $E$ is finite, then every cofinal $E'$ contains
$\Sigma^{-N}\Sigma^\infty E_N$ for $N\gg0$.
\end{itemise}
\end{prop}
\begin{prop}[greatest element of a morphism]\hfil
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(i)] If maps $f,g:E\to F$ agree on cofinal $B\subset E$ then $f=g$.
\itm[(ii)] If $E',E''\subset E$ are cofinal and $f':E'\to F$ and $f'':E''\to F$
are equivalent, then $f'=f''$ on restriction to $E'\cap E''$.
\itm[(iii)] Any two maps representing the same morphism agree on the
intersection of their domains. In particular there is a unique map in every
morphism with support containing the support of all the others, and all the
others are restrictions thereof. Call this the greatest element of the morphism.
\end{itemise}
\end{prop}
\begin{defn}[cofiber]\hfil
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(a)] Given a map $f:E\to F$ define the cone $Cf=\{C(f_n)\}$. This is a
spectrum as $S(C(f_n))$ decomposes as $SF_n\cup C(SE_n)$. Note that $C(f_n)$ is
the unreduced mapping cone.
\itm[(b)] If $\phi:E\to F$ is a morphism with greatest element $f':E'\to F$,
the cone $C\phi$ is defined to be the cone $Cf'$, and called the cofiber.
\end{itemise}
\end{defn}
\begin{prop}
The cone of a morphism of finite spectra is a finite spectrum. The cone of a
morphism of spectra of finite type is of finite type.
\end{prop}
Given a CW-complex $X$, define the smash product $E\wedge X$ levelwise. Then
\begin{defn}[homotopy]\hfil
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(a)] Given maps $g_0,g_1:E\to F$, a homotopy $g_0\simeq g_1$ is a map
$G:E\wedge I^+\to F$ such that $G|_{E\wedge\{i,*\}}=g_i$. This is just a 
levelwise homotopy compatible with the suspension structure.
\itm[(b)] We say that morphisms $\phi_0,\phi_1:E\to F$ are homotopic if for some
cofinal spectrum $E'$, there are homotopic maps $g_i:E'\to F$ such that
$g_i\in\phi_i$.
\end{itemise}
\end{defn}
\noindent Thus we can form the homotopy category $\HS$ with objects spectra and
morphisms homotopy classes of morphisms. The isomorphisms here are called
equivalences. The cones of homotopic morphisms are equivalences.
\begin{thm}[Whitehead]
A morphism is an equivalence iff it induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups 
$\pi_*(\DASH):=[\Sigma^kS,\DASH]$ for all $k\in\Z$.
\end{thm}
\begin{prop}
The spectra $S^1\wedge E$ and $\Sigma E$ are equivalent.
\end{prop}
\begin{defn} 
A sequence $X\to Y\to Z$ in $\scrS$ is a \emph{cofiber sequence} if it admits a
homotopy commuting diagram as follows, with vertical arrows equivalences:
\[\xymatrix{
X\ar[r]\ar[d]&Y\ar[r]\ar[d]&Z\ar[d]\\
E\ar[r]^\phi&F\ar[r]&C\phi
}\]
\end{defn}
\begin{lem}\hfil
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(i)]If $X\to Y\to Z$ is a cofiber sequence, there is a map $Z\to \Sigma X$
such that $X\to Y\to Z\to \Sigma X$ is a long cofiber sequence.
\itm[(ii)]The construction of this map is somehow natural: given two cofiber
sequences and the full arrows, such that the left square is homotopy
commutative, we can find dotted arrows such that everything is homotopy
commutative (with rows\ long cofiber sequences):
\[\xymatrix{
X\ar[r]\ar[d]^\alpha&
Y\ar[r]\ar[d]&Z\ar@{.>}[d]\ar@{.>}[r]&
\Sigma X\ar[d]^{\Sigma\alpha}\\
X\ar[r]&Y\ar[r]&Z\ar@{.>}[r]&\Sigma X'
}\]
\itm[(iii)]$\Sigma^\infty$ maps cofiber sequences of CW-complexes to cofiber
sequences of spectra.
\end{itemise}
\end{lem}
As suspension distributes over wedge, the levelwise wedge of spectra is a
spectrum, and
\begin{prop}
The wedge of spectra is the coproduct in $\HS$.
\end{prop}
As $[E,F]=[S^2\wedge E,\Sigma^2F]$ all the homsets have an abelian group
structure from the comulitplication on $S^2$. Moreover, composition is
biadditive, and $\HS$ is an additive category (see 1.16). As we can desuspend we
can form long cofiber sequences in both directions, and:
\begin{thm}
For any spectrum $E$, applying $\Hom(\DASH,E)$ to the long cofiber sequence
\[\xymatrix{
\cdots\ar[r]&\Sigma^{-1}Y\ar[r]^{\Sigma^{-1}g}&
\Sigma^{-1}Z\ar[r]&X\ar[r]^f&
Y\ar[r]^g&Z\ar[r]&\Sigma X\ar[r]^{\Sigma f}&\Sigma Y\ar[r]&\cdots
}\]
gives a long exact sequence, \textbf{and so does applying} $\Hom(E,\DASH)$.
\end{thm}
\begin{prop}\hfil
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(i)]For all $F$ there is an isomorphism of abelian groups:
\[\{i^*_\lambda\}:[\vee_\lambda E(\lambda)]\to\prod_\lambda[E(\lambda),F],
\qquad\{i^*_\lambda\}(f)=\{fi_\lambda\}.\]
\itm[(ii)]For all $F$ there is an isomorphism of abelian groups:
\[\langle(i_k)_*\rangle:\bigoplus_{k=1}^m\lambda[F,E(k)]\to
[F,\vee_{k=1}^m E(k)]\]
\itm[(iii)]For all finite $F$ there is an isomorphism of abelian groups:
\[\langle(i_k)_*\rangle:\oplus_\lambda[F,E(\lambda)]\to
[F,\vee_\lambda E(\lambda)]\]
\end{itemise}
\end{prop}
\noindent By 1.16(ii), $[X,X\vee X]\simeq[X,X]\oplus[X,X]$. Under this
isomorphism, $(\id_X,\id_X)$ corresponds to a homotopy class $\nabla:X\to X\vee
X$, called \emph{coaddition}. Moreover, addition in $[X,E]$ is given by
\[\xymatrix{[X,E]\oplus[X,E]\ar[r]^{\ \ \simeq}&
[X\vee X,E]\ar[r]^{\ \ \ \nabla^*}&[X,E].}\]
\begin{prop}
Let $\xymatrix{X\ar[r]^f&Y\ar[r]^g&Z}$ be a cofiber sequence. Then TFAE:
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(i)]The morphisms $g$ us innessential; and
\itm[(ii)]There is a splitting $s:Y\to X$ such that $fs\simeq\id_Y$.
\end{itemise}
If these hold then $X\simeq \Sigma^{-1}Z\vee Y$.
\end{prop}
\begin{defn}\hfil
\begin{itemise}
\itm A \emph{prespectrum} is simply a sequence of pointed spaces and pointed
maps.
\itm A CW-\emph{prespectrum} is one in which the spaces are pointed
CW-complexes, and the maps are cellular, but not CW-inclusions.
\end{itemise}
\end{defn}
\begin{lemdef}[spectral substitute]
For every prespectrum $X=\{X_n,t_n\}$ there is a spectrum $\{E_n,s_n\}$ and
pointed homotopy equivalences $f_n:E_n\to X_n$ forming a map of prespectra. Any
such $E$ is called a \emph{spectral substitute} for the prespectrum $X$.

If $X$ is a CW-spectrum in which for some $k$, $(X_n)^{(n+k)}=*$ for all $n$,
then we can choose $E$ such that $E^{(k)}=*$.
\end{lemdef}
\begin{defn}
A prespectrum $X$ is called an $\Omega$-\emph{prespectrum} if each adjoint
$X_n\to \Omega X_{n+1}$ is a homotopy equivalence. A spectrum is called an
$\Omega$-\emph{spectrum} if it is an $\Omega$-prespectrum.
\end{defn}
\begin{prop}[Adams]
Every spectrum is equivalent to an $\Omega$-spectrum.
\end{prop}
\begin{prop}
If $A,B\subset E$ are subspectra such that $A\cup B=E$, and $h:A\vee B\to E$ is
the wedge of inclusions, then $Ch\simeq\Sigma(A\cap B)$.
\end{prop}
\noindent A mapping telescope construction is given for spectra. To appear.
\subsection{The smash product, duality, ring and module spectra}
\begin{thm}
There is a construction $E,F\mapsto E\wedge F$ of smash product such that
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(i)]It is a covariant functor in each argument.
\itm[(ii)]The are the expected natural equivalences ``$a,\tau,l,r,\Sigma$'':
\[(E\wedge F)\wedge G\simeq E\wedge(F\wedge G),\ E\wedge F\simeq F\wedge E,\
S\wedge E\simeq E\simeq E\wedge S,\ \Sigma E\wedge F\simeq \Sigma(E\wedge F).\]
\itm[(iii)]There are natural equivalences $E\wedge X\simeq E\wedge \Sigma^\infty
X$ for CW-complexes $X$.
\itm[(iv)]If $f:E\to F$ is an equivalence, so is $f\wedge \id_G$.
\itm[(v)]The natural morphism $\vee_\lambda(E_\lambda\wedge
F)\to(\vee_\lambda(E_\lambda))\wedge F$ is an equivalence.
\itm[(vi)]If $A\to B\to C$ is a cofiber sequence, so is $A\wedge E\to B\wedge
E\to C\wedge E$.
\end{itemise}
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
There are compatibilities up to homotopy between:
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(i)] Different ways to associate a quadruple smash;
\itm[(ii)] $\tau^2$ and the identity (swapping order twice does nothing);
\itm[(iii)] Associating and commuting terms;
\itm[(iv)] Smashing with $S$ and associating in various ways;
\itm[(vii)] Smashing with $S$ and commuting;
\itm[(viii)] $\tau:S\wedge S\to S\wedge S$ and $\id_s$.
\end{itemise}
\end{thm}
\begin{defn}
A map $u:S\to A\wedge A^\perp$ is called a duality if for all $E$, the maps
%\[[A,E]\to[S,E\wedge A^\perp],\qquad (A\to E)\mapsto (S\to A\wedge A^\perp\to 
\begin{alignat*}{2}
u_E:[A,E]\to[S,E\wedge A^\perp],&\qquad &
(A\to E)\mapsto (S\to A\wedge A^\perp\to E\wedge A^\perp)\\
u^E:[A^\perp,E]\to[S,A\wedge E],&\qquad &
(A^\perp\to E)\mapsto (S\to A\wedge A^\perp\to A\wedge E)
\end{alignat*}
are isomorphisms. Duality is symmetric, as smash product is homotopy
commutative. Moreover, given two dualities, we have isomorphisms
$[A,B]\longrightarrow[S,B\wedge A^\perp]\longleftarrow[B^\perp,A^\perp]$, so
that we can define the adjoint $f^\perp:B^\perp\to A^\perp$ of a map $f:A\to B$.
\end{defn}
\begin{lem}
Given a map $f:A\to B$ there is a compatibility
\[\xymatrix{
\ar[d]^{f^*}[B,E]\ar[r]^{\cong\ \ \ }&
[S,E\wedge B^\perp]\ar[d]^{(\id_E\wedge f^\perp)_*}\\
[A,E]\ar[r]^{\cong\ \ \ }&[S,E\wedge A^\perp]
}\]
which shows that the dual is unique up to equivalence when it exists, and that
$(A^\perp)^\perp\simeq A$.
\end{lem}
\begin{lem}
Let $A$ and $A^\perp$ be two finite spectra.
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(i)]Suppose $u:S\to A\wedge A^\perp$ is such that $u_E$ and $u^E$ are
isomorphisms for $E=\Sigma^k S$. Then $u$ is a duality.
\itm[(ii)]If $u$ is a duality, then for any $E,F$ the homomorphisms
\begin{alignat*}{2}
_Fu_E:[F\wedge A,E]\to[F,E\wedge A^\perp],&\qquad &
(F\wedge A\to E)\mapsto (F\to F\wedge A\wedge A^\perp\to E\wedge A^\perp)\\
^Fu^E:[A^\perp\wedge F,E]\to[F,A\wedge E],&\qquad &
(A^\perp\wedge F\to E)\mapsto (F\to A\wedge A^\perp\wedge F\to A\wedge E)
\end{alignat*}
are isomorphisms, so that internal hom objects exist in this setting.
\itm[(iii)]Given a dual for $A$ and $B$, a dual for $A\wedge B$ is
$B^\perp\!\wedge A^\perp$, via:
\[S\to A\wedge A^\perp\to A\wedge S\wedge A^\perp\to 
A\wedge B\wedge B^\perp\!\wedge A^\perp.\]
\end{itemise}
\end{lem}
\setcounter{thm}{6}
\begin{defn}
Spectra $A$ and $B$ are called \emph{$n$-dual} if $A$ and $\Sigma^{-n}B$ are
dual (a symmetric relation). Spaces are called \emph{stably $n$-dual} if their
suspension spectra are $n$-dual.
\end{defn}
\begin{exmp}
Let $X$ be a finite cellular subspace of $\R^n$, and let $U$ be a regular
neighbourhood (one that admits a deformation retract onto $X$). Then $X$ is
stably $n$-dual to $\R^n\setminus U$. This is Spanier-Whitehead duality, and the
map is explicitly constructed here.

Let a finite CW-complex $X$ be cellularly embedded in a sphere $S^n$ and let $U$
be a regular neighbourhood of $X$ therein. They construct explicity a duality
morphism showing that $X^+$ is stably $n$-dual to $\overline U/\partial U$.
\end{exmp}
\begin{cor}
Every finite CW-space admits an $n$-dual finite CW-space for $n\gg0$, and every
finite spectrum admits a finite dual.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
The first claim follows as every finite CW-space can be embedded in some large
sphere. The next follows as a finite spectrum $A$ has $A\simeq
\Sigma^{-m}\Sigma^\infty A_m$ for $m\gg0$, then finding some $n$-dual space to
$A_m$, we're done.
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}
The dual of a cofiber sequence is a cofiber sequence.
\end{prop}
\begin{statement*}
If $X$ and $Y$ are finite CW-complexes such that 
$\Sigma^\infty X\simeq\Sigma^\infty Y$ then $S^NX\simeq S^NY$ for $N\gg0$.
If $f,g:X\to Y$ are maps of finite CW-complexes and $\Sigma^\infty
f\simeq\Sigma^\infty g$, then $S^Nf\simeq S^Ng$ for $N\gg0$.
\end{statement*}
\begin{proof}
Fix homotopy inverse morphisms $\Sigma^\infty X\longleftrightarrow\Sigma^\infty
Y$. Consider the composite of these, a self map of $\Sigma^\infty X$ homotopic
to $\id_{\Sigma^{\infty}X}$. The homotopy is a \emph{map}
$\Sigma^r\Sigma^{\infty}S^rX\wedge I^+\to\Sigma^\infty X$ for some $r$, by
1.5(iii) and 1.5(NB). In particular, the homotopy to the identity is defined
eventually.

The second statement follows from a similar argument, or, according to the text,
from the Freudenthal suspension theorem.
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}[duals of finite complexes {\small(follows from above statement)}]
Fix $n$.
\begin{itemise}
\itm[(i)]Suppose $X$ is a finite CW-space with a finite CW $n$-dual $X'$. Then
the homotopy type of $S^NX'$ is determined by that of $X$ for $N\gg0$.
\itm[(ii)] Let $f:X\to Y$ be a map of finite CW-spaces with $n$-duals as above.
Then for some $N$ there is a map $f':S^NY'\to S^NX'$ such that
$\Sigma^{-N}\Sigma^\infty \Sigma^Nf$ and $\Sigma^{-N}\Sigma^\infty f'$ are dual
morphisms. Moreover, $f'$ is unique up to homotopy for $N\gg0$.
\itm[(iii)]If we perform the process in (ii) on both maps in a cofiber sequence
$X\to Y\to Z$ of finite CW-spaces, then $S^NZ'\to S^NY'\to S^NX'$ is a cofiber
sequence for $n\gg0$.
\end{itemise}
\end{thm}
\begin{defn}
A \emph{ring spectrum} is a triple $(E,\mu,\imath)$ where $\mu:E\wedge E\to E$
and $\imath:S\to E$ satisfy the ring axioms up to homotopy. It may be or may not
be commutative. A \emph{module spectrum} over a ring spectrum is a pair $(F,m)$
satisfying the module axioms up to homotopy (with a unitarity condition).
\end{defn}
\setcounter{thm}{13}
\begin{condef}
Given a module $F$ over a ring $E$, and a morphism $a:S^d\to E$, the morphism
\[a_\#:S^d\wedge F\xrightarrow{\ a\wedge 1\ }
E\wedge F\xrightarrow{\ \ m\ \ } F\]
is called multiplication by $a$.
\end{condef}
\begin{prop}
Let $E\to E'$ be a ring morphism. If $\xymatrix{S^d\ar[r]^a&E\ar[r]&E'}$ is
inessential then so is the morphism $a_\#:S^d\wedge E'\to E'$.
\end{prop}
