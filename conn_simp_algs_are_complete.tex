\title{Connected simplicial algebras are Andr\'e-Quillen complete}
\author{Michael Donovan}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
We modify a classical construction of Bousfield and Kan to define the Adams tower of a simplicial nonunital algebra over a field $k$. We relate this construction to Radulescu-Banu's cosimplicial resolution, and prove that the all connected simplicial algebras are complete with respect to Andr\'e-Quillen homology. This is a convergence result for the unstable Adams spectral sequence for commutative algebras over $k$.
\end{abstract}

The classical unstable Adams spectral sequence was defined in two ways by Bousfield and Kan. In \cite{BousKanSSeq.pdf} they define an Adams tower for a reduced simplicial set, and define the Adams spectral sequence to be the homotopy spectral sequence of this tower. The tower is built by \emph{deriving functors with respect to a ring}.
 Later, in \cite{BK_pairings_products.pdf}, they make another construction of the spectral sequence using cosimplicial methods, namely, they construct \emph{the resolution of a space with respect to a ring}, and take the spectral sequence of this cosimplicial space.

In this paper, we will work in the category $s\calC$ of simplicial non-unital algebras over a field $k$. For any $X\in s\calC$, Radulescu-Banu \cite{radelescuBanu.pdf} gave a cosimplicial resolution $\calX^\bullet$ of $X$, analogous to the resolution of a space with respect to a ring. Having done so, he defines the completion of $X$ with respect to abelianisation to be the simplicial algebra
\[X^{\hat\,}:=\textup{Tot}(\calX^\bullet),\]
and defines the absolute Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence of $X$ to be the spectral sequence of the cosimplicial object $\calX^\bullet$. Its target is $\pi_*X^{\hat\,}$. 

More precisely, Radulescu-Banu constructs a comonad structure on the cofibrant replacement functor $c:s\calC\to s\calC$ arising from Quillen's small object argument, and mixes $c$ into the standard cobar construction arising from the adjunction $Q:s\calC\leftrightarrows s\calV:K$, obtaining a coaugmented cosimplicial object 
\[

}}.\]
In particular, there is a natural completion map $cX\to\textup{Tot}(\calX^\bullet)$, and we say that $X$ is \emph{complete with respect to Andr\'e-Quillen homology} when this map is an equivalence.
For background, general theory, and another approach, see Blum-Riehl and Bous03. The purpose of this paper is to prove
\begin{theorem}\label{completenesstheorem}
Suppose that $k$ is a field, and that $X$ is a connected simplicial $k$-algebra. Then the completion map $X\to X{\hat{\,}_\textup{\!\!AQ}}$ is an equivalence.
\end{theorem}
In order to analyse the failure of the completion map $X\to \pi_*X^{\hat\,}$ to be an equivalence,

an Adams spectral sequence for simplicial algebras, by finding an appropriate cosimplicial resolution of a simplicial algebra with respect to Andr\'e-Quillen homology. Thus, he obtained a spectral sequence with target the homotopy of a certain completion $X{\hat\,}$ of $X$.

\item The classical unstable Adams spectral sequence was defined in two ways by Bousfield and Kan. In \cite{BousKanSSeq.pdf} they define an Adams tower for a reduced simplicial set, and define the Adams spectral sequence to be the homotopy spectral sequence of this tower. The tower is built by \emph{deriving functors with respect to $R$}.
 Later, in \cite{BK_pairings_products.pdf}, they make another construction of the spectral sequence using cosimplicial methods, namely, they construct \emph{the resolution of a space with respect to $R$}, and take the spectral sequence of this cosimplicial space.
\item The first construction lends itself well to analysis of the completion map $X\to X{\hat\,}$, while the second construction lends itself to the description of the $E^2$ page by homotopical algebra, and to the construction of a Whitehead product on the Adams spectral sequence.
\item Radulescu-Banu \cite{radelescuBanu.pdf} constructed an Adams spectral sequence for simplicial algebras, by finding an appropriate cosimplicial resolution of a simplicial algebra with respect to Andr\'e-Quillen homology. Thus, he obtained a spectral sequence with target the homotopy of a certain completion $X{\hat\,}$ of $X$.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the completion map $X\to X{\hat\,}$ by reconstructing Radulescu-Banu's spectral sequence by a method analogous to Bousfield and Kan's first method in the classical case. That is, by \emph{deriving functors with respect to Andr\'e-Quillen homology}. We will be able to prove theorem \ref{completenesstheorem}, conjectured by Radelescu-Banu. We will also prove that three different ways to define the spectral sequence coincide.

\begin{theorem}\label{completenesstheorem}
Suppose that $k$ is a field, and that $X$ is a connected simplicial $k$-algebra. Then the completion map $X\to X{\hat{\,}_\textup{\!\!AQ}}$ is an equivalence.
\end{theorem}

\section{Functors derived with respect to abelianisation and the Adams tower}

\section{Relationship with Radulescu-Banu's cosimplicial resolution}
In this paper we work in the category $\calC$ of nonunital commutative algebras over a field $k$. These are simply $k$-vector spaces $A$ equipped with a commutative and associative pairing $A\otimes A\to A$.
\begin{itemise}
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item Explain RB's resolution.
\item The spectral sequence may be defined to be either the spectral sequence of the bicomplex or the spectral sequence of the Tot tower, thanks to \cite[Lemma 2.2]{BousfieldHSSCS.pdf}.
\item By results of \cite[{X.4.9}]{YellowMonster}, all (truncated) cosimplicial groups are Reedy fibrant.
\item It converges to the totalisation of the resolution, which we make the definition of $X{\hat\,}$.
\item Explain that Blum-Riehl and Bousfield together give a partial description of the $E^2$.
\end{itemise}




\section{The Tot tower and functors derived with respect to Andr\'e-Quillen homology}
\begin{itemise}
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item As explained by Sinha, we can model the Tot tower of the Radulescu-Banu resolution by the tower of homotopy limits induced by the inclusions
\[\cdots\to P_0[n-1]\to P_0[n]\to P_0[n+1]\to\cdots \to P_0[\infty]\]
\item Then we can pull back the tower under $\scrX^{-1}$ to a tower over $\scrX^{-1}$, and the terms are a definition of the total homotopy fiber of a cube.
\item Define derived functors wrt Quillen homology, and note that they coincide with the alternative definition of the total homotopy fiber. That's the point, really.
\item rejig it to have fewer cofibrant replacements and then prove a connectivity result. Call it a twisting lemma. Does it follow from the $n=1$ case just like for B\&K? Eh probably screw it.
