\CONVERSATION{Winter Reading; medium-term project}{Haynes}{29/11/2011}
Over winter:
\begin{itemise}
\item Read parts of Ravanel's book:
\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\item The Adams spectral sequence;
\item The $\Lambda$-algebra;
\item The appendix on formal groups.
\end{enumerate}
\item A project:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item For $X$ a spectrum, $p$ an odd prime, the we have a spectral sequence:
\[\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p)\implies\pi_*(X^\wedge_p)\]
from the $\Ext$ groups over the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra to the homotopy groups of the $p$-completion of $X$.
\item Suppose that $X$ is connective. Then
\begin{thm*}
There is a line of some slope on the SS, above which we can calculate exactly what the spectral sequence does.
\end{thm*}
\item Note that we normally draw the ASS so that the vertical coordinate measures $s$, while the horizontal measures $t-s$. Thus, the vertical coordinate reflects the filtration \emph{and} topological degrees.
\item Every spectrum is a module over the sphere spectrum $\mathbb{S}$. With $X=\mathbb{S}$, there is an element $q_0$ in some position on the $y$-axis of the $E_2$ page. Presumably this element detects the first nontrivial homotopy in the $p$-localised sphere.

Well, this element acts on any adams spectral sequence. In particular, there is, for general $X$, a localisation map:
\[\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p)\to q_0^{-1}\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p).\]
This map is an isomorphism above the line. Moreover, we have an equality:
\[q_0^{-1}\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p)\cong H(H^*(X,\F_p);\beta)\otimes\F_p[q_0^{\pm1}],\]
so that above the line, the spectral sequence in determined by the Bockstein spectral sequence for $X$, which we can calculate!
\item There's a conjecture related to all this on Haynes' website.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemise}

\CONVERSATION{The Kan loop group, a theorem of Dold}{Haynes}{6/12/2011}
Kan associates functorially to each reduced\footnote{A simplicial set is reduced if it has only one 0-simplex.} simplicial set a simplicial abelian group, which is free in each degree:
\[G:s\mathsf{Set^{\textup{red}}}\to s(\mathsf{FreeGp})\]
such that the homotopy type of $G(X)$ is that of $\Omega X$ (in some appropriate sense). This gives a strictification of the loops functor.

Given a group, one can take the filtration arising from the lower central series to obtain a graded Lie algebra. If the group was free, we obtain a free graded Lie algebra on the generators.

If we instead take maximal $\F_p$-vector space quotients, we get a filtration whose associated graded is a free \emph{restricted} Lie algebra, yielding
\[L:\mathsf{Gp}\to\mathsf{GrLieAlg}^{\textup{rest}}\]


Now if we take a reduced simplicial set $X$, the simplicial group $GX$ has a lower central series in each degree, and so we obtain a simplicial graded free restricted Lie algebra.
\[L_*G:s\mathsf{Set^{\textup{red}}}\to s(\mathsf{GrLieAlg}^{\textup{rest}}) \]

Some missing details here, pointing out that the generators of the graded Lie algebra are the elements in the first filtered degree --- the elements of the maximal $\F_p$-vector space quotient of the group $GX$.

The following is a theorem of \textbf{Dold}: Suppose that $H:\mathsf{Vect}_\F\to\mathsf{Vect}_\F$ is a functor. Then there is a functor $\calH$ giving a commuting diagram:
\[\xymatrix{
s\mathsf{Vect}_{\F}\ar[r]^{H_*}\ar[d]^{\pi_*}&
s\mathsf{Vect}_{\F}\ar[d]^{\pi_*}\\
\mathsf{GrVect}_{\F}\ar@{-->}[r]^{\calH}&\mathsf{GrVect}_{\F}
}\]
That is, the homotopy of $H_*X$ is in fact a functor in the homotopy of $X$.

All this could be stitched together to give a spectral sequence going from the homology of $X$ to the homotopy. See a paper of Curtis in `Advances in Math', 1970s, with the word `simplicial' in the title.

\textbf{Problem}: Kan and Bousfield have another spectral sequence with this source and target, and the relationship between these is not fully understood.
