\CONVERSATION{$E_{\infty}$-operads and algebras; localising a ring spectrum at a homotopy class}{Haynes}{8/11/2011}
The space of long knots in an $E_2$-algebra.

For each $n\geq0$, let $\scrL(n)=\textup{Isom}((\R^\infty)^n,\R^\infty)$. This is an $E_\infty$-operad. In has an action on (a suitable construction of) $BO$.

The connective $K$-theory spectrum is the $\Omega$-spectrum whose spaces are (starting at level zero)
\begin{alignat*}{2}
(\Z\times BU)\langle 3\rangle&=BSU%&\qquad&\text{()}
\\U\langle 2\rangle&=SU%&\qquad&\text{()}
\\(\Z\times BU)\langle 1\rangle&=BU%&\qquad&\text{()}
\\U\langle 0\rangle&=U%&\qquad&\text{()}
\\(\Z\times BU)\langle -1\rangle&=\Z\times BU%&\qquad&\text{()}
\end{alignat*}
It has homotopy polynomial in the 2-dimensional generator. In fact, if we invert the two-dimensional generator, we recover the $K$-theory spectrum.

On way to invert a homotopy element $f:S^n\to E$ is to form the composite $\Sigma^nE\overset{f\sprod1}{\to}E\sprod E\to E$, and use it to form the colimit of:
\[E\to\Sigma^{-n}E\to\Sigma^{-2n}E\to\Sigma^{-3n}E\to\cdots.\]

\CONVERSATION{Winter Reading; medium-term project}{Haynes}{29/11/2011}
Over winter:
\begin{itemise}
\item Read parts of Ravanel's book:
\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\item The Adams spectral sequence;
\item The $\Lambda$-algebra;
\item The appendix on formal groups.
\end{enumerate}
\item A project:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item For $X$ a spectrum, $p$ an odd prime, the we have a spectral sequence:
\[\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p)\implies\pi_*(X^\wedge_p)\]
from the $\Ext$ groups over the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra to the homotopy groups of the $p$-completion of $X$.
\item Suppose that $X$ is connective. Then
\begin{thm*}
There is a line of some slope on the SS, above which we can calculate exactly what the spectral sequence does.
\end{thm*}
\item Note that we normally draw the ASS so that the vertical coordinate measures $s$, while the horizontal measures $t-s$. Thus, the vertical coordinate reflects the filtration \emph{and} topological degrees.
\item Every spectrum is a module over the sphere spectrum $\mathbb{S}$. With $X=\mathbb{S}$, there is an element $q_0$ in some position on the $y$-axis of the $E_2$ page. Presumably this element detects the first nontrivial homotopy in the $p$-localised sphere.

Well, this element acts on any adams spectral sequence. In particular, there is, for general $X$, a localisation map:
\[\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p)\to q_0^{-1}\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p).\]
This map is an isomorphism above the line. Moreover, we have an equality:
\[q_0^{-1}\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p)\cong H(H^*(X,\F_p);\beta)\otimes\F_p[q_0^{\pm1}],\]
so that above the line, the spectral sequence is determined by the Bockstein spectral sequence for $X$, which we can calculate!
\item There's a conjecture related to all this on Haynes' website.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemise}

\CONVERSATION{The Kan loop group, a theorem of Dold}{Haynes}{6/12/2011}
Kan associates functorially to each reduced\footnote{A simplicial set is reduced if it has only one 0-simplex.} simplicial set a simplicial abelian group, which is free in each degree:
\[G:s\mathsf{Set^{\textup{red}}}\to s(\mathsf{FreeGp})\]
such that the homotopy type of $G(X)$ is that of $\Omega X$ (in some appropriate sense). This gives a strictification of the loops functor.

Given a group, one can take the filtration arising from the lower central series to obtain a graded Lie algebra. If the group was free, we obtain a free graded Lie algebra on the generators.

If we instead take maximal $\F_p$-vector space quotients, we get a filtration whose associated graded is a free \emph{restricted} Lie algebra, yielding
\[L:\mathsf{Gp}\to\mathsf{GrLieAlg}^{\textup{rest}}\]


Now if we take a reduced simplicial set $X$, the simplicial group $GX$ has a lower central series in each degree, and so we obtain a simplicial graded free restricted Lie algebra.
\[L_*G:s\mathsf{Set^{\textup{red}}}\to s(\mathsf{GrLieAlg}^{\textup{rest}}) \]

Some missing details here, pointing out that the generators of the graded Lie algebra are the elements in the first filtered degree --- the elements of the maximal $\F_p$-vector space quotient of the group $GX$.

The following is a theorem of \textbf{Dold}: Suppose that $H:\mathsf{Vect}_\F\to\mathsf{Vect}_\F$ is a functor. Then there is a functor $\calH$ giving a commuting diagram:
\[\xymatrix{
s\mathsf{Vect}_{\F}\ar[r]^{H_*}\ar[d]^{\pi_*}&
s\mathsf{Vect}_{\F}\ar[d]^{\pi_*}\\
\mathsf{GrVect}_{\F}\ar@{-->}[r]^{\calH}&\mathsf{GrVect}_{\F}
}\]
That is, the homotopy of $H_*X$ is in fact a functor in the homotopy of $X$.

All this could be stitched together to give a spectral sequence going from the homology of $X$ to the homotopy. See Curtis, ``Simplicial homotopy theory'' (Advances in Math.\ 6 1971 107).

\textbf{Problem}: Kan and Bousfield have another spectral sequence with this source and target, and the relationship between these is not fully understood.

\CONVERSATION{The Adams Spectral sequence}{Haynes}{12/1/2012}
\newcommand{\Pproj}{\calP_{\textup{proj}}}
\newcommand{\Pseq}{\calP_{\textup{seq}}}
Suppose that $\calA$ is a triangulated (an in particular, additive) category. Call a pair of composable maps $A'\to A\to A''$ a \emph{sequence} if it has composite zero.

We're going to give a definition of ``relative homological algebra''. This will be relative to a pair $(\Pproj,\Pseq)$, where $\Pproj$ is a class of objects called `relative projectives', and $\Pseq$ is a class of sequences called `relative sequences', satisfying:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item A sequence $A'\to A\to A''$ is a relative sequence \Iff the following is exact for every $P\in\Pproj$:
\[\calA(P,A')\to\calA(P,A)\to\calA(P,A'')\]
\item An object $P$ is a relative projective \Iff for all relative sequences $A'\to A\to A''$, the above is exact.
\item There are enough projectives, in the sense that for every object $X$, we can find a relative projective $P$ and a relative sequence $P\to X\to0$.
\end{itemize}
Such a structure is enough to give a model category structure on the category of positively graded chain complexes on $\calA$.

\begin{exmp*}
Given a ring homomorphism $f:A\to B$, we can give such a structure on the category of $B$-modules. Say that a $B$-module $P$ is $f$-projective \Iff it's a retract of a module $B\otimes_AQ$.\footnote{Note that if $P$ is $f$-projective, then $P$ is in fact a retract of $B\otimes_AP|_A$.} The relative sequences are then determined as those sequences $M'\to M\to M''$ which are split exact when restricted to $A$.
\end{exmp*}
\begin{exmp*}
Hochschild homology is a relative $\Tor$ group.
\end{exmp*}

Now, suppose that $\calA$ is a triangulated category with a \textbf{stable} injective class. That is, with all the same structure dualised, and such that an object is injective \Iff all of its suspensions are injective.

\begin{shaded}
I don't know if we're going with projective or injective right now.
\end{shaded}

Let $\calA=\ho(\scrS)$, and let $R$ be a ring spectrum (i.e.\ a tensor monoid) such that $\pi_{*}(R)$ is commutative. 
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item We'll say that $P\in\calA$ is $R$-projective \Iff it's a retract of some spectrum of the form $R\sprod X$. That is, \Iff the map $P\to R\sprod P$ has a section.
\item We'll say that $X'\to X\to X''$ is an $R$-sequence if it is split exact (what does this mean?????) after smashing with $R$. At very least we want each three term sequence $\pi_{n}(R\sprod X')\to\pi_{n}(R\sprod X)\to\pi_{n}(R\sprod X'')$ to be exact.\footnote{For an example, suppose that $R=HA$, the Eilenberg-MacLane spactrum associated with an abelian group $A$. Then $R\sprod X$ is a new spectrum whose homotopy is the homology of $X$.}
\end{itemize}
Now take an injective resolution
\[\xymatrix@R=.5cm@C=.5cm@!C{
X\ar[dr]&%r1c1
&%r1c2
&%r1c3
&%r1c4
&%r1c5
&%r1c6
&%r1c7
\\%r1c8
&%r2c1
I^0\ar[rr]&%r2c2
&%r2c3
I^1\ar[rr]&%r2c4
&%r2c5
I^2\ar[rr]&%r2c6
&%r2c7
\cdots%r2c8
}\]
and complete it to an $R$-Adams resolution:
\[\xymatrix@R=.5cm@C=.5cm@!C{
X\ar[dr]&%r1c1
&%r1c2
X^1\ar@{~>}[ll]\ar[dr]&%r1c3
&%r1c4
X^2\ar@{~>}[ll]\ar@{..>}[dr]&%r1c5
&%r1c6
&%r1c7
\\%r1c8
&%r2c1
\ar[ur]I^0\ar[rr]&%r2c2
&%r2c3
\ar[ur]I^1\ar[rr]&%r2c4
&%r2c5
I^2\ar[rr]&%r2c6
&%r2c7
\cdots%r2c8
}\]
Note that at this stage, we can form the dotted arrow, as the composite $X^1\to I^2$ is null.

Now the fibre in a triangulated category is not canonically defined, instead it is only defined up to non-canonical isomorphism. However, any two of these resolutions are isomorphic, and the failure of the isomorphism to be canonical dies by the $E_2$ page of the spectral sequence.


Now \textbf{assume} that $R_*R$ is flat over $R_*:=\pi_{*}(R)$. This happens when $R$ is any of $H\F$ ($\F$ any field), $K$ and $\textup{MU}$, but not for $H\Z$. With this assumption, we obtain co-operations on the $R$ homology of any spectrum
\[R_*(X)\to R_*(R)\otimes_{R_*}R_*(X).\]
Putting $X=R$, we obtain the diagonal map making $(R_*,R_*R)$ a Hopf algebroid.

Now by our flatness assumption, the category of $R_*R$-comodules is abelian. We define:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item the relative injectives to be the retracts of extended modules $R_*R\otimes_{R_*}(?)$
\item the relative sequences to be... the same as last time?
\end{itemize}
Via these definitions, we have relative homological algebra.

Now we have a Hurewicz map 
\[\pi_{*}(X)\to\Hom_{R_*R}(R_*,R_*(X))\]
 obtained as follows. Given $f:\mathbb{S}\to \Sigma^{-n}X$ and $g:\mathbb{S}\to \Sigma^{-m}R$, we produce:
\[
\xymatrix@1{
\mathbb{S}\ar@{=}[r]&%r1c1
\mathbb{S}\sprod\mathbb{S}\ar[r]^-{f\sprod g}&%r1c2
\Sigma^{-n}X\sprod \Sigma^{-m}R\ar@{=}[r]&%r1c3
\Sigma^{-n-m}X\sprod R
}\]
Moreover, if $X$ is $R$-injective, this is an isomorphism. So, if we apply homotopy to obtain an exact couple:
\[\xymatrix@R=.5cm@C=.5cm@!C{
\pi_*X\ar[dr]&%r1c1
&%r1c2
\pi_*X^1\ar@{~>}[ll]\ar[dr]&%r1c3
&%r1c4
\pi_*X^2\ar@{~>}[ll]\ar[dr]&%r1c5
&%r1c6
&%r1c7
\\%r1c8
&%r2c1
\ar[ur]\pi_*I^0\ar[rr]&%r2c2
&%r2c3
\ar[ur]\pi_*I^1\ar[rr]&%r2c4
&%r2c5
\pi_*I^2\ar[rr]&%r2c6
&%r2c7
\cdots%r2c8
}\]
we find that the bottom row can be replaced with
\[\Hom_{R_*R}(R_*,R_*(I^0))\to\Hom_{R_*R}(R_*,R_*(I^1))\to\Hom_{R_*R}(R_*,R_*(I^2))\to\cdots.\]
So as long as $R_*$ maps resolutions of spectra to resolutions of comodules, we will be able to identify the  $E_2$ page with some derived functor (Ext, right? Or is this Cotor or something!?)

\begin{rmk*}
Convergence is trivial when $R=MU$ and $X$ is connective. In this case, we can make the map $X\to I^0$ an isomorphism on the bottom homotopy group, and thus, push the connectivity of the $X^i$ higher and higher.
\end{rmk*}
