\CONVERSATION{Winter Reading; medium-term project}{Haynes}{29/11/2011}
Over winter:
\begin{itemise}
\item Read parts of Ravanel's book:
\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\item The Adams spectral sequence;
\item The $\Lambda$-algebra;
\item The appendix on formal groups.
\end{enumerate}
\item A project:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item For $X$ a spectrum, $p$ an odd prime, the we have a spectral sequence:
\[\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p)\implies\pi_*(X^\wedge_p)\]
from the $\Ext$ groups over the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra to the homotopy groups of the $p$-completion of $X$.
\item Suppose that $X$ is connective. Then
\begin{thm*}
There is a line of some slope on the SS, above which we can calculate exactly what the spectral sequence does.
\end{thm*}
\item Note that we normally draw the ASS so that the vertical coordinate measures $s$, while the horizontal measures $t-s$. Thus, the vertical coordinate reflects the filtration \emph{and} topological degrees.
\item Every spectrum is a module over the sphere spectrum $\mathbb{S}$. With $X=\mathbb{S}$, there is an element $q_0$ in some position on the $y$-axis of the $E_2$ page. Presumably this element detects the first nontrivial homotopy in the $p$-localised sphere.

Well, this element acts on any adams spectral sequence. In particular, there is, for general $X$, a localisation map:
\[\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p)\to q_0^{-1}\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p).\]
This map is an isomorphism above the line. Moreover, we have an equality:
\[q_0^{-1}\Ext^{s,t}_\calA(H^*(X),\F_p)\cong H(H^*(X,\F_p);\beta)\otimes\F_p[q_0^{\pm1}],\]
so that above the line, the spectral sequence in determined by the Bockstein spectral sequence for $X$, which we can calculate!
\item There's a conjecture related to all this on Haynes' website.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemise}
