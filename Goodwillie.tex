\begin{Calculus I}
\begin{itemise}
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item A homotopical functor $\scru\to\scrt$ is:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item  \textbf{excisive} if it sends (homotopy) pushouts to (homotopy) pullbacks.
\item \textbf{reduced} if it sends the final object to a contractible space. (?)
\end{itemize}
\item We can  form the reduction $\widetilde{F}$ of a functor $F$ by defining $\widetilde{F}:Y\mapsto\fiber(F(Y)\to F(*))$.
\item If the (homotopical) functor is excisive and reduced, we call it \textbf{linear}, and the spaces $F(S^i)$ form an $\Omega$-spectrum, called the coefficient spectrum.
\item If $F$ is only reduced, the $F(S^i)$ form a prespectrum, whose associated spectrum is $\partial F(*)$, the derivative of $F$ at $*$.
\item The differential of $F$ at $*$ is the (possibly nonlinear) functor
\[D_*F:Y\mapsto\hocolim\left(\widetilde{F}(Y)\to\Omega\widetilde{F}(SY)\to\Omega^2\widetilde{F}(S^2Y)\to\cdots \right)\]
When $F$ is \emph{stably excisive}, $D_*F$ is linear with coefficient spectrum $\partial F(*)$, and is the best linear approximation to $\widetilde{F}$: there's a natural transformation $\widetilde{F}\nt D_*F$, and its fiber, a functor $\scru\to\scrt$, approximately \emph{doubles connectivity}.

$F$ is \textbf{stably excisive} if for some constant $c$, we have connectivities as marked in:
\[\xymatrix{

}\]

\item In general, we can form the derivative at a based space $(X,x)$, the spectrum:
\[\partial_xF(X)= \left\{\fiber\left(F(X\vee S^i)\to F(X)\right)\right\}_\Omega\]
and the differential, a functor on spaces over $X$:
\[D_XF:\scru_X\to\scrT\textup{\qquad approximating the functor\qquad }y\mapsto\fiber(F(Y)\to F(X)).\]
\item There is a notion of analytic, which means `stably $n$-excisive for every $n$'. If a functor is analytic, one can construct a Taylor tower:
\[\xymatrix{
\textup{homog deg 2}\ar[r]&\ar[d]P_2X\\
D_XF(Y)\ar[r]&\ar[d]P_1X\\
X\ar@{=}[r]
&P_0X
}
\]
with fibers \emph{homogeneous} of the relevant degree, and layers $P_n$ the best $n$-excisive approximation (?). When $Y\to X$ is $(\rho+1)$-connected, the tower converges to $F(Y)$. (Somehow, a number $\rho$ gets involved.)
\end{itemise}
\paragraph*{Conventions}
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item We define $\hocolim$s via a simplicial bar construction and geometric realisation.
\item Use the term `prespectrum' for any sequence of  pointed spaces and maps $C_i\to\Omega C_{i+1}$, and `spectrum' when these are equivalences. To $\Omega$-fy, one uses the spectrum $\left\{ \hocolim_j\Omega^jC_{j+i}\right\}$:
\[\xymatrix@=3mm{
\makebox[0cm][r]{$\hocolim($}C_0
\ar[r]
&
\Omega C_1
\ar[r]
&%r1c1
\Omega^2 C_2
\ar[r]
&%r1c2
\Omega^3C_3
\ar[r]
&%r1c3
\makebox[0cm][l]{$\cdots )$}&%r1c4
\\
&
\makebox[0cm][r]{$\hocolim($}C_1
\ar[r]
&
\Omega C_2
\ar[r]
&%r1c1
\Omega^2 C_3
\ar[r]
&%r1c3
\makebox[0cm][l]{$\cdots )$}&%r1c4
\\
&&
\makebox[0cm][r]{$\hocolim($}C_2
\ar[r]
&
\Omega C_3
\ar[r]
&%r1c3
\makebox[0cm][l]{$\cdots )$}&%r1c4
}\]
Equivalence of spectra is defined levelwise, equivalence of prespectra is defined by equivalence on $\Omega$-fications.
\item Suppose we want to form a prespectrum, but only have maps
\[C_j\to D_j\overset{\sim}{\from}E_j\to\Omega C_{j+1}.\]
Then we can form a prespectrum whose $j^\textup{th}$ term is
\[\holimit\left(C_j\to D_j\overset{\sim}{\from}E_j\to\Omega C_{j+1}\to D_{j+1}\overset{\sim}{\from}E_{j+1}\to\Omega C_{j+2}\to\cdots \right).\]
The hocolim doesn't see the fact that one of the maps goes the wrong way, so that this is essentially just $C_j$, but now has an evident map to loops on the term above it, giving a prespectrum.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Differentiation of functors}
\begin{itemise}
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item We with to turn suitable functors $F:\scru\to\scrt$ into linear functors $D_XF:\scrU_X\to\scrt$. By linear, we mean:
\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item homotopical;
\item excisive: sending cartesian squares to cocartesian squares;
\item reduced: sending the terminal element $X$ to a contractible space.
\end{enumerate}
\item (Take $X=*$.) Given a linear functor $L:\scru\to\scrt$, we have diagrams
\[\vcenter{\xymatrix{
Y
\ar[r]
\ar[d]
&%r1c1
CY
\ar[d]
\\%r1c2
CY
\ar[r]
&%r2c1
SY%r2c2
}}\qquad \mapsto\qquad 
\vcenter{\xymatrix{
L(Y)
\ar[r]
\ar[d]
&%r1c1
\ast
\ar[d]
\\%r1c2
\ast
\ar[r]
&%r2c1
L(SY)%r2c2
}}\qquad \implies \qquad \Omega L(SY)\overset{\sim}{\to}L(Y).
\]
Thus we obtain a spectrum $\textbf{L}(Y)$ with terms $L(S^jY)$, and a generalised homotopy theory by defining $h_*(Y)=\pi_{*+i}L(S^iY)$.
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item In fact, each $L_j:\scru\to\scrt$ is linear, as is $\textbf{L}:\scru\to\scrs$, the category of spectra.
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item A linear functor $\textbf{L}:\scru\to\scrs$ can be recovered from $\textbf{L}_0:\scru\to\scrt$ via a chain of weak equivalences between $\left\{L_j(Y)\right\}$ and $\{L_0(S^jY)\}$.
\item There are functors as follows, and a comparison natural transformation
\[\xymatrix{
\textup{Linear}(\scru,\scrs)
\ar[r]^-{\textup{ev}_{S^0}}
\ar@{=}[d]^{}="mideq"
&%r1c1
\scrs
\ar[dl]^-{\textbf{L}_\DASH }
\\%r1c2
\textup{Linear}(\scru,\scrs)
&%r2c1
%r2c2
\ar@{}[u];"mideq"|(.7){\Longleftarrow}
}\]
Now the natural transformation is an equivalence on finite complexes, and there's a limit axiom which a linear functor may satisfy in order that it is always an equivalence.

In particular, a linear functor is determined on finite complexes by the coefficient spectrum $\{L(S^j)\}$.
\end{itemize}
\item Define endofunctors $C_X,S_X:\scru_X\to\scru_X$, by letting $C_X$ be the mapping cone on the structure map $Y\to X$, and defining $S_X$ by the evident pushout. Then one may think of a linear functor $\scru_X\to\scrt$ as a `homology theory on $\scru_X$'.
\item \textbf{Examples:} 
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item The functor $Q_+:\scru\to\scrt$ defined by $Y\mapsto\colim(\Omega^i(S^i\wedge Y_+))$ is an excisive homotopy functor. Its reduction is linear, with coefficients the sphere spectrum $\Sigma^\infty_+(*)$.
\item Given any fibration $E\downarrow X$, one may define an excisive homotopy functor $\scru_X\to \scrt$, given by $Y\mapsto Q_+(E\times _XY)$. The reduction is again linear.
\end{itemize}
\item A linear functor $L:\scru_X\to \scru$ has a coefficient spectrum $\{L(X\vee _ xS^i)\}$ at \textbf{each} point $x\in X$.\\
\textbf{Proposition 1.7:} If a map $L\nt M$ of linear functors $\scru_X\to\scrt$ induces an equivalence of coefficient spectra at all $x\in X$, and the functors satisfy the limit axiom, the $L(Y)\to M(Y)$ is an equivalence for all $Y\in\scrU_X$.
\item \textbf{Stable excision}: a functor satisfies `stable excision' if $E(c,\kappa)$ holds for some $c,\kappa$: whenever $k_1,k_2\geq\kappa$, we have connectivities:
\[\xymatrix{
&%r1c1
&%r1c2

}\]
The Blakers-Massey theorem states that the identity functor has $E(1,0)$.
\item If $\Phi:\scru_X\to\scrt$ is a homotopy functor, define
\[\xymatrix@R=0mm{
\ar[r]^-{T\Phi}%Name of map
\scru_X&%Source
\scrt\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \\%Target
Y%x
\ar@{|->}[r]&
\holimit\left(\Phi(C_XY)\to \Phi(S_XY)\from\Phi(C_XY)\right)%f(x)
%\ar@{}[ul];[l]|{\rotatebox{90}{\tiny$\in$}} \ar@{}[u];[]|{\rotatebox{90}{\tiny$\in$}} 
}\]
This is another homotopy functor, and if $\Phi$ has $E(c,\kappa)$, $T\Phi$ has $E(c-1,\kappa-1)$. There's a natural map $t:\Phi\nt T\Phi$, which is an isomorphism when $\Phi$ is excisive. In particular, the functor
\[\xymatrix@R=0mm{
\ar[r]^-{P\Phi}%Name of map
\scru_X&%Source
\scrt\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad\qquad\quad  \\%Target
Y%x
\ar@{|->}[r]&
\hocolim(\Phi(Y)\to (T\Phi)(Y)\to (T^2\Phi)(Y)\to\cdots )%f(x)
%\ar@{}[ul];[l]|{\rotatebox{90}{\tiny$\in$}} \ar@{}[u];[]|{\rotatebox{90}{\tiny$\in$}} 
}\]
is excisive whenever $\Phi$ is stably excisive.
\item If $F:\scru\to\scrt$ is any functor, and $X$ is a space, we have a restriction $\Phi:\scru_X\to\scrt$. We define
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item the \textbf{1-jet} of $F$ at $X$ to be $P_XF=P\Phi:\scru_X\to \scrt$;
\item the \textbf{differential} of $F$ at $X$ to be the reduction $D_XF=\overline{D_XF}$.
\end{itemize}
Both are excisive homotopy functors, while only the differential need be linear.
\item Two functors $\Phi,\Psi:\scru_X\to \scrt$ \textbf{agree to first order} via $f:\Phi\nt\Psi$ if
\[\calO(c,\kappa):\quad \textup{whenever $Y\downarrow X$ is $k$-connected and $k\geq\kappa$, $\Phi(X)\to \Psi(Y)$ is $(2k-c)$-connected}.\]
If $\Phi:\scru_X\to\scrt$ is stably excisive:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item $P\Phi$ is excisive; $D\Phi$ is linear;
\item $\Phi$ agrees with $P\Phi$ to first order, as does $\overline{\Phi}$ with $D\Phi$
\end{itemize}
If $F:\scru\to\scrt$ is stably excisive and $X$ is any space:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item $P_XF$ is excisive; $D_XF$ is linear;
\item As functors $\scru_X\to\scrt$, $F$ agrees with $P_XF$ to first order, as does $\overline{F}$ with $D_XF$
\end{itemize}
We define the \textbf{derivative} of $F$ at $(X,x)$ to be the coefficient spectrum of $D_XF$ at $x$, written $\partial_xF(X)$.
\end{itemise}
\rednote{There's a little more stuff here, mostly on the meaning of the term `best approximation', but I feel like doing something else.}
\end{Calculus I}
\begin{shaded}
\paragraph*{Differentials and derivatives}
Now in the calculus of functions $f:\R^n\to \R$, we calculate the directional derivative at $Y\in\R^n$ along a vector $v\in\R^n$ by the formula:
\[\partial_vf(Y)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} n\left(f(Y+v/n)-f(Y)\right).\]
The vectors $v$ that we use are exactly what's needed in order to describe how the function changes close to $Y$.

Now suppose that $F:\scrt\to\scrt$ is any functor. We'll restrict it to a functor $F:\scrt_Y\to\scrt$ --- we should only really care about the values of this functor near $Y$, anyway, and the spaces near $Y$ are those with a highly connected map to $Y$.

Now we'd like to calculate derivatives in various `directions', but \emph{which directions do we mean}? Suppose that $X\downarrow Y$ is an element of $\scrt_Y$, so that in particular it has a section. I suppose we can, up to weak equivalence, take $X\downarrow Y$ to be a relative CW complex. In this case, $X-Y$ has a cell $c$ of lowest dimension, say $n$. It may have many cells of lowest dimension, but we could add them on one at a time anyways, so we'll just suppose that $c$ is the only cell of that dimension. We're just approximating, so we'll also ignore all the higher cells, which are less significant anyway. Thus, $X$ has the form $Y\cup_{\partial \alpha}D^n$, for $\alpha\in\pi_{n-1}(Y)$. Now $\alpha$ must be zero, as the following composite is the identity:
\[\pi_{n-1}(Y)\to \pi_{n-1}(X)\to \pi_{n-1}(Y)\qquad \alpha\mapsto0\mapsto\alpha.\]
Thus, \emph{we only really need to think about} terms $X=Y\vee _yS^n$ for points $y\in Y$. That is, the points of $Y$ are like the directions one can travel from $Y$ --- they are the places at which you can glue the a `lowest cell'.

Now, to form an analogy with the previous formula, one starts by linearising $F$, to form $D_XF$. The question of what the deriviates should be is still interesting --- it has not vanished just because we have straightened out the functor a little. Thus we are led to consider, for each $y\in Y$, the object:
\[\partial_yF(Y):=\colim \left\{\Omega^nD_XF(Y\vee _yS^n)\right\}.\]
%
%
%\textbf{}
%
%\pagebreak
%
%Here's a thought on derivatives of functors $F:\scrt\to\scrt$. We should be able to form a differential $D_XF$ at any point $X$ of the domain $\scrt$. In normal calculus, this is the linear function induced on tangent spaces; here it will be a little different.
%
%Here, instead of being defined on a tangent space, the differential $D_XF$ is defined for spaces close to $X$, that is, spaces $Y$ with a map to $X$. This probably isn't the best way to say this, but I don't know what is.

\subsection*{III.2 Delooping homogeneous functors}
\begin{thm*}[\textbf{2.1}]
The functor
$
\calH_n(\calC,\calS p)\overset{\Omega^\infty}{\to}\calH_n(\calC,\calT)
$
has an inverse up to weak equivalence.
\end{thm*}
This will be easy enough given a delooping on $\calh_n(\calc,\calt)$, written $F\mapsto BF$:
\begin{lem*}[\textbf{2.2}]
Let $n>0$. If $F:\calC_Y\to\calT$ is
any reduced ($F(Y)\sim *$) homotopy functor, then up to natural equivalence
there is a fibration sequence
$$\CD
                            P_nF @>{q_nF}>> P_{n-1}F @>>> R_nF
\endCD
$$
in which the functor $R_nF$ is $n$-homogeneous.
\end{lem*}




More precisely, we will obtain a
natural  diagram of homotopy functors
\[
\CD
P_nF @>{q_nF}>> P_{n-1}F\\
@A{\sim}AA @AA{\sim}A\\
\hat P_nF @>>> \tilde P_{n-1}F\\
@VVV @VVV\\
K_nF @>>> R_nF
%\endCD
\endCD\tag{2.3}
\]
in which the marked arrows are equivalences, the lower square
is cartesian,
$R_nF$ is
$n$-homogeneous, and $K_nF$ is contractible. (If $F$ were not reduced,
then in fact $K_nF$ would be equivalent to the constant functor
$F(Y)$.)
