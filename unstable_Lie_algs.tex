\section{Conventions and notation}
\subsection{Categories of universal graded algebras}
In this paper we will be dealing with various categories of universal graded algebras [BS?,Quillen], and as such, it serves to set notation globally. The categories we will deal with are all monadic over a category of graded $\F_2$-vector spaces (of finite type ??),
%Indeed, for any two integers $m,n\geq0$, let $\vect{m}{n}$ be the category of finite type graded $\F_2$-vector spaces with $m$ cohomological gradings and $n$ homological gradings. That is, an object $V$ of $\vect{m}{n}$ may be written
%\[V=\bigoplus_{p_m,\ldots,p_1,q_n,\ldots,q_1\geq0}V_{q_n,\ldots,q_1}^{p_m,\ldots,p_1},\]
%in which each $V_{q_n,\ldots,q_1}^{p_m,\ldots,p_1}$ is a finite dimensional $\F_2$-vector space. In fact, we will restrict to 
namely, the category of vector spaces with $r$ non-negative homological gradings and a single strictly positive cohomological grading. We will denote the category of such $\F_2$-vector spaces by the symbol $\vect{+}{r}$, so that an object $V$ of $\vect{+}{r}$ decomposes as
\[V=\bigoplus_{s_r,\ldots,s_1\geq0,\,t\geq 1}V^{t}_{s_r,\ldots,s_1}.\]
Similarly, we write $\vect{r}{+}$ for the category of $\F_2$-vector spaces with one positive homological grading and $r$ non-negative cohomological gradings. Lastly, we write $\vect{}{}$ for the category of (ungraded) $\F_2$-vector spaces, and  $\vect{+}{}$ for $\vect{+}{0}$.

For each algebraic category $\calC$ of interest in this paper, an object $X$ of $\calC$ may be defined as a graded vector space $X\in\vect{+}{r}$ along with certain binary and unary operations on $X$ (and without any nullary operations). As such, there will be a forgetful functor $U_\calC:\calC\to\vect{+}{r}$, which will admit a left adjoint, always denoted $F_\calC:\vect{+}{r}\to\calC$ for notational consistency. The functor $U_{\calC}$ will always be monadic, in the sense that the natural comparison functor from $\calC$ to the category of algebras over the monad $U_{\calC}F_{\calC}$ on $\vect{+}{r}$ is an equivalence.

It will also happen that for each $\calC$, there is a functor $K_\calC:\vect{+}{r}\to \calC$ which sends $V\in\vect{+}{r}$ to the `trivial object on $V$', and $K_{\calC}$ has a left adjoint, $Q_{\calC}:\calC\to\vect{+}{r}$, which sends $X\in\calC$ to `the quotient of $X$ by the image of its non-trivial operations'. In terms of free constructions, the monad $U_{\calC}F_{\calC}$ will admit an augmentation $\epsilon:U_{\calC}F_{\calC}\to\textup{id}$, and the functor $K_\calC$ sends any object $V\in\vect{+}{r}$ to the $U_{\calC}F_{\calC}$-algebra whose structure map is $\epsilon_V:U_{\calC}F_{\calC}V\to V$. Moreover, the functor $Q_{\calC}$ sends $X\in \calC$ with structure map $\rho:F_\calC U_\calC X\to X$ to the coequaliser in $\vect{+}{r}$ of the maps $U_\calC\rho$ and $\epsilon_{U_\calC X}$.

\subsection{Quillen's model structure on $s\calC$ and $\calC$-homology}
For any of the algebraic categories $\calC$ herein we use Quillen's simplicial model category structure on the category $s\calC$. In this structure, the weak equivalences (fibrations) are the maps which are weak equivalences (fibrations) of simplicial abelian groups (so that every object is fibrant), and every cofibrant object is a retract of an \emph{almost free} object. A simplicial object $X_\bullet$ is almost free if there are subspaces $V_n\subseteq X_n$ for each $n\geq0$ such that the structure map $F_{\calC}U_\calC V_n\to X_n$ is an isomorphism for all $n$, and such that these subspaces are preserved by all of the degeneracies and face maps of $X_\bullet$ except for $d_0$.

For a simplicial resolution functor $\calC\to s\calC$, we'll often use the standard simplicial bar construction arising from the $F_\calC\dashv U_\calC$ adjunction [cite?]. More explicitly, given $X\in\calC$, we define $B_\bullet^\calC X\in s\calC$ by iteration of the comonad $F_\calC U_\calC$, although we will tend to supress the $U_\calC$ in our notation:
\[B_s^\calC X=(F_\calC)^{s+1}X.\]
The face maps are given by the formula $d_i=(F_\calC)^i\epsilon$, and the degeneracies by $s_i=(F_\calC)^i\beta$, where $\epsilon$ and $\beta$ are respectively the counit and diagonal of the comonad $F_\calC U_\calC$. This object is almost free, with $B_s^\calC X$ generated by its subspace $(F_{\calC})^sX$. It is standard that the augmentation $B_\bullet^\calC X\to X$ is an acyclic fibration.

For $X\in\calC$, we define the $\calC$-\emph{homology} of $X$ by the formula:
\[H_*^{\calC}X=\pi_*(Q_\calC B_\bullet^\calC X)=H_*N_*(Q_\calC B_\bullet^\calC X).\]
This is well defined, as the $Q_\calC\dashv K_\calC$ adjunction is a Quillen adjunction (indeed $K_\calC$ evidently preserves fibrations and acyclic fibrations), and we are free to use any cofibrant replacement in place of $B_\bullet^\calC X$. We define the $\calC$-cohomology $H^*_\calC X$ to be the linear dual of $H_*^\calC X$. Note that if $\calC$ is monadic over $\vect{+}{r}$, then $H_*^{\calC}X\in \vect{+}{r+1}$, and $H^*_{\calC}X\in \vect{r+1}{+}$. That is, each homology group $H_s^\calC X$ retains the gradings of $X$, and a new homological grading is added (to the left of the existing homological gradings). If we dualise to obtain cohomology, the cohomological gradings and homological gradings are swapped. We will uniformly avoid substituing into the location of an upper or lower $*$, for the sake of clarity. For example, suppose that $\calC$ is monadic over $\vect{+}{2}$, then we will write $(H_*^\calC X)_{s_3,s_2,s_1}^t$, instead of $(H_{s_3}^\calC X)_{s_2,s_1}^t$


\subsection{$\calC$-$\Pi$-algebras, free $\calC$-$\Pi$-algebras and the smash product}
\todo{Various intro here}{Say what a $\calC$-$\Pi$-algebra is, even with all the gradings.
\item Construct the free $\calC$-$\Pi$-algebra on a set (\textbf{what happens on a vector space?}).
\item Say what a model is. Move the discourse on spheres in $\textup{ch}_+\vect{}{}$ to somewhere above. Also, put some discourse on the smash product into this paragraph.}
...

Now suppose that $X_0$ and $X_1$ are models in $s\calC$, which is to say that are each is almost free, and weakly equivalent to a wedge of spheres. Then the natural map $i:(\pi X_0)\sqcup (\pi X_1)\to \pi(X_0\sqcup X_1)$ is an isomorphism, since both source and target represent the free $\calC$-$\Pi$-algebra on generators corresponding to the wedge summands of $X_0$ and $X_1$ taken together. Moreover, the natural map $\pi(X_0\times X_1)\to (\pi X_0)\times (\pi X_1)$ is an isomorphism (as products of Lie algebras are taken in vector spaces). Thus we have a commuting square
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
(\pi X_0)\sqcup (\pi X_1)
\ar[r]
\ar[d]^-{i}_-{\cong}
&%r1c3
(\pi X_0)\times (\pi X_1)
\ar[d]_-{\cong}\\
\pi (X_0\sqcup X_1)
\ar[r]
&%r1c3
\pi (X_0\times X_1)
}\]
This shows that the long exact sequence coming from $X_0\wedge X_1\to X_0\sqcup X_1\to X_0\times X_1$ is just a short exact sequence, and that there is a commuting diagram
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
0\ar[r]&%r1c1
(\pi X_0)\wedge (\pi X_1)
\ar[r]
\ar[d]^-{i}_-{\cong}
&%r1c2
(\pi X_0)\sqcup (\pi X_1)
\ar[r]
\ar[d]^-{i}_-{\cong}
&%r1c3
(\pi X_0)\times (\pi X_1)
\ar[r]
\ar[d]_-{\cong}
&%r1c4
0\\%r1c5
0\ar[r]&%r1c1
\pi (X_0\wedge  X_1)
\ar[r]
&%r1c2
\pi (X_0\sqcup X_1)
\ar[r]
&%r1c3
\pi (X_0\times X_1)
\ar[r]
&%r1c4
0
}\]
In particular, for $X_0$ and $X_1$ models, there is an isomorphism $i:(\pi X_0)\wedge (\pi X_1)\to\pi(X_0\wedge X_1)$ (natural for maps of pairs of models), and the map $\pi(X_0\wedge X_1)\to \pi(X_0\sqcup X_1)$ is a monomorphism.

For any simplicial object $A\in s\calC$, there's a natural map $\gamma:Q_{\calC\PiAlg}\pi A\to \pi Q_{\calC}A$.
\begin{lem}
If $A$ is a model, then $\gamma:Q\pi A\to \pi QA$ is an isomorphism.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
$A$ is homotopic to a wedge of spheres, and $\pi A$ is free on generators in correspondence with the wedge summands.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Quadratic part, quadratic decomposition maps and cohomology operations}\label{quadratic part section}
\emph{special} EZ maps\textbf{?}

In this section, we'll give conditions under which one can define natural operations on the cohomology groups $H^*$. The method here is simply the direct generalisation of Goerss' approach in [GoerssBook,\S5].

Suppose that $\calC$ is an algebraic category as above. Then we may define a map of vector spaces:
\[\quadratic:F_\calC V\to (F_\calC V)\wedge (F_\calC V)\]
to be the unique factorisation of $\overline{\quadratic}:F_\calC V\to (F_\calC V)\sqcup (F_\calC V)$ through the smash product, where
$\overline{\quadratic}=F_\calC(\Delta)+i_0+i_1$. \textbf{Is that what I mean?}

Suppose now that we are given a natural map 
\[j_\calC:Q_\calC(X_0\wedge X_1)\to Q_\calC(X_0)\otimes Q_\calC(X_1).\]
Then we'll write $j_\calC\quadratic$ for the composite
\[F_\calC V\overset{\quadratic}{\to}(F_\calC V)^{\wedge 2}\to Q_\calC((F_\calC V)^{\wedge 2})\overset{j_\calC}{\to}V^{\otimes 2}.\]
We'll say that $j_\calC$ is a \emph{quadratic decomposition map} for $\calC$ if $j_\calC\circ Q_\calC( \tau)=\tau\circ j_\calC$, where $\tau$ stands for either of the two symmetry isomorphisms, and if the following equation of maps $F_\calC F_\calC V\to V\otimes V$ is satisfied:
\[j_\calC\quadratic\circ(u_{F_\calC V} + {F_\calC u_V})=j_\calC\quadratic\circ\mu_V,\]
(where $\mu$ here stands for the multiplication map of the monad $F_\calC U_\calC$). \textbf{housekeeping:} order of exposition.
%\[F_\calC F_\calC V\overset{u_{F_\calC V}}{\to}F_\calC V\overset{j_\calC\quadratic}{\to}V^{\wedge 2}\]
%\[F_\calC F_\calC V\overset{{F_\calC u_V}}{\to}F_\calC V\overset{j_\calC\quadratic}{\to}V^{\wedge 2}\]
%\[F_\calC F_\calC V\overset{{\mu}}{\to}F_\calC V\overset{j_\calC\quadratic}{\to}V^{\wedge 2}\]
%(where $\mu$ here stands for the multiplication map of the monad $F_\calC U_\calC$).





%We would like to provide operations on the cohomology $H^*_\calC X$ of an object of $\calC$. Instead, take

Suppose that $X_\bullet\in s\calC$ is almost free, with $V_s\subset X_s$ the freely generating subspace. Then for each $s$, the functor 
\[\Hom_\calC(X_s,\DASH)\cong \Hom_\calV(V_s,U_\calC\DASH)\]
is naturally an $\F_2$-vector space. If $\phi_s=\F_\calC(\Delta):X_s\to X_s\sqcup X_s$ is the map induced by the vector space diagonal $\Delta:V_s\to V_s\oplus V_s$, then the addition operation `$\star$' on $\Hom_\calC(X_s,\DASH)$ is given by $f\star g= (f\sqcup g)\circ\phi_s$. Now let
%
%
% Each of the $\F_2$-vector spaces $V_s$ is a co($\F_2$-vector space) object, with comultiplication map the diagonal $V_s\to V_s\oplus V_s$. Applying $F_\calC$, each $X_s$ becomes a cogroup object, with comultiplication $\phi_s:X_s\to X_s\sqcup X_s$.
$\overline{\xi}_\calC=((d_0\sqcup d_0)\phi_s)\star(\phi_{s-1}d_0)$, the sum of maps in the $\F_2$-vector space $\textup{Hom}_\calC(X_s,X_{s-1}\sqcup X_{s-1})$. It is completely formal to check that $\overline{\xi}_\calC$ maps to zero in the group
\[\textup{Hom}_\calC(X_s,X_{s-1}\times X_{s-1})=\textup{Hom}_\calC(X_s,X_{s-1})\times \textup{Hom}_\calC(X_s,X_{s-1}),\]
and thus $\overline{\xi}_\calC$ factors through a unique map $\xi_\calC:X_s\to X_{s-1}\wedge X_{s-1}$. Furthermore, $\xi_\calC$ enjoys the symmetry $\tau\xi_\calC=\xi_\calC$, and it is again formal to verify:
\begin{lem}[Goerss, Lemma 5.5]
The map $Q_\calC\xi_\calC$ induces a chain map of degree $-1$ on normalised complexes:
\[N_s(Q_{\calC}X_\bullet)\to N_{s-1}((Q_{\calC}(X_\bullet\wedge X_\bullet))^{\Sigma_2}).\]
\end{lem}
We now have access to the composite
\[\psi_\calC:\left(N_s(Q_{\calC}X_\bullet)\overset{Q_\calC\xi_\calC}{\to} N_{s-1}((Q_{\calC}(X_\bullet\wedge X_\bullet))^{\Sigma_2})\overset{j_\calC}{\to} N_{s-1}(S^2(Q_{\calC}X_\bullet))\right),\]
which we can use to define operations on $\calC$-cohomology. We will construct such operations from certain generic operations, defined for any $U\in s\calV$:
\begin{gather*}
\ExtCohOp^k:H^{n}((N_*U)^*)\to H^{n+k}((N_*(S^2U))^*),\textup{ zero unless $0\leq k\leq n$, and}\\
\ExtCohProd:H^{n_1}((N_*U)^*)\otimes H^{n_2}((N_*U)^*)\to H^{n_1+n_2}((N_*(S^2U))^*).
\end{gather*}
These operations are defined as follows. In all that follows, let $\{D_k\}$ be a special cup-$k$ product [Singer \S1.9], and define $\oldphi:\left(C_mU\right)^*\otimes \left(C_mU\right)^*\to \left(C_m(U\otimes U)\right)^*$ by
\[\oldphi:\left(N_mU\overset{\alpha}{\to}\F_2\right)\otimes \left(N_mU\overset{\beta}{\to}\F_2\right)\mapsto\left(N_m(U\otimes U)\overset{\alpha\otimes\beta}{\to}\F_2\otimes \F_2\overset{\cdot}{\to}\F_2\right).\]
Then define a cochain map:
\[m_\textup{ext}:(N_*U)^*\otimes (N_*U)^*\to (N_*S^2U)^*\]
and functions
\[S^k_\textup{ext}:(N_mU)^*\to (N_{m+k}S^2U)\]
by the formulae, for $\alpha\in (N_{n_1}U)^*$ and $\alpha\in (N_{n_2}U)^*$
\[m_\textup{ext}(\alpha\otimes\beta)=D_0^*\oldphi(\alpha\otimes\beta),\quad S^k_\textup{ext}(\alpha)=D^*_{n_1-k}\oldphi(\alpha\otimes \alpha)+D^*_{n_1-k+1}\oldphi(\alpha\otimes d\alpha),\]
where we regard the $D^*_k$ as maps into $(N_*S^2U)^*$ by composition with the projection from $(N_*(U\otimes U))^*$. one checks that these operations are well defined by the same arguments as in [Singer \S1.12].

Following Goerss [\S3], one notes that the linear maps $\ExtCohOp^k$ induce dual operators
\[(\ExtCohOp^k)^*:H_*(NS^2U)\to H_{*-k}(NU)\]
whenever these groups are locally finite dimensional. One can define the operations $(\ExtCohOp^k)^*$ directly, without the double dualisation as follows. If $\sigma_i$ and $\pi_*(1+T)$ are the maps of Goerss[\S3], then any element of $x\in H_m(NS^2U)$ can be written as a sum
\[x=\sum_j\pi_*(1+T)(y_j\otimes z_j)+\sum_{0\leq k\leq \lfloor m/2\rfloor}\sigma_k(x_k),\]
where $x_k\in H_{m-k}(NU)$.
Then the map $(\ExtCohOp^k)^*$ sends $x$ to this $x_k$.





{\tiny \textbf{The following argument is wrong. Just check it in the special case of interest to us.} Anyway, we should check that these operations are in fact natural in $X$, and in particular do not depend on the almost free structure chosen. In order to give a definition that is evidently natural, for any $X$, we might define the operations as follows. For any $X\in s\calC$, let $X^c\in s\calC$ be the bar construction on $X$. Then $X^c$ is almost free, and for any map $f:X\to Y$, the map $X^c\to Y^c$ preserves the generating subspaces. If we define operations on $H^*X=\pi_*(Q_\calC X^c)^*$ using this almost free structure, then the map $H^*X\from H^*Y$ induced by $f$ will commute with these operations. All that remains is to show that when $X$ is already almost free, the operations defined above coincide with the operations just defined using the bar construction.

If $V_n\subseteq X_n$ is the space of generators, and if $\epsilon:X^c\to X$ is the acyclic fibration associated with the bar construction, notice that $\epsilon^{-1}(V_n)$ is contained in the generaing subspace of $(X^c)_n$. Now as $\epsilon$ is an acyclic fibration, and $X$ is cofibrant, the map $X^c\to X$ admits a section $s:X\to X^c$, and $S(V_n)$, being contained in $\epsilon^{-1}(V_n)$, consists only of generators for $(X^c)_n$. As $s:X\to X^c$ preserves generators, it induces a map on cohomology that commutes with the operations, and so its inverse $\epsilon^*$ must also commute with the operations. Thus the two modes of defining operations on $H^*_\calC X$ coincide.

[\textbf{Maybe} it's better to be brief, saying --- one might be concerned that this definition depends on the choice of almost free replacement. However, if $X\in s\calC$ is almost free, although the acyclic fibration $\epsilon:B^\calC X\to X$ does not preserve the generating subspaces, any section of $\epsilon$ \emph{must} preserve the generating subspaces, and as $X$ is almost free, such a section must exist.] \textbf{Actually, for this you} \emph{need that the kernel of the augmentation of the monad $F_\calC$ is preserved by the multiplication (or similar), else it's not true that only generators map down to generators! Don't forget to include this in the discourse on $\calC$.}}

\subsection{Decomposition maps for $\calW(n)$ and $\calL(n)$}
\todo{Describe the composition maps for these categories}{show the compatibility under $\calL(n)\PiAlg\cong \calW(n+1)$
\item Drop the stuff about a general $\calC$}
\textbf{Figure out where this stuff should go.}
Suppose that the algebraic category $\calC$ admits a decomposition map $j_\calC$. Then we \cancel{may} construct a decomposition map for $\calC\PiAlg$ as follows. \textbf{Can we?} [I'm not sure whether or not you can get all elements. Maybe if you give everything at least one positive grading, you can express everything as a quotient of free $\Pi$-algebras, and then do something clever. I don't know. For now I'll write:]
Then a decomposition map $j_{\calC\PiAlg}$ for $\calC\PiAlg$ is \emph{compatible} with $j_\calC$ if, whenever $X_0$ and $X_1$ are models in $s\calC$, the following diagram commutes:
\[
\xymatrix@C-1em@R0em{
& \pi Q(X_0\wedge X_1) \ar[rr]^{\pi(j_{\calC})} && \pi(QX_0\otimes QX_1) \ar[dr]^{\textup{AW}\makebox[0cm][l]{(swap for EZ other way?)}}_{\cong} \\
Q\pi(X_0\wedge X_1) \ar[ur]^{\gamma} &&&& (\pi QX_0)\otimes (\pi QX_1) \ar[dl];[]^{\gamma\otimes\gamma}_{\cong} \\
& Q((\pi X_0)\wedge (\pi X_1)) \ar[ul]^{\cong}_{Q(i)} && (Q\pi X_0)\otimes (Q\pi X_1) \ar[ll];[]^{j_{\calC\PiAlg}}
}
\]
%Then $j_{\calC\PiAlg}$, so far defined only on for pairs of free $\calC$-$\Pi$-algebras, has the requisite symmetry, since every other map in the diagram does.

\item Write $\vect{m}{n}$ for the category of loc fin vecspaces with $m$ upper, $n$ lower indices
\item Use blackboard bold symbol $\pgr$ to denote only strictly positive gradings
}
Write $\Palg$ for Goerss' algebra, generated by $P^2,P^3,\ldots,$. This can be viewed as a graded associative algebra in $\vect{1}{0}$, by thinking of the generator $P^i$ as having grading $i+1$ (or even in $\vect{1}{1}$, taking $P^i\in(\Palg)^{i+1}_1$). For an object $V\in\vect{+}{0}$, the tensor product $\Palg\otimes V$ is an object of $\vect{+}{0}$ in the evident way. Write $\PMonad$ for the monad for unstable modules (in which everything is defined, but you set various $P$ to zero).

Next, the Lie operad $\LieOperad$ can be $\vect{1}{0}$-graded by viewing the elements of $\scrL(n)$ as having grading $n-1$. Write $S(\LieOperad)$ for the free $S(\scrL)$-algebra monad (\textbf{already mentioned this above} following FresseSimplicialAlgs.pdf and his posets paper, 1.2.16), and $\Lambda(\LieOperad)$ for the good Lie algebra monad. Both of these monads are now monads on $\scrV(1,0)$.

In order to construct the monad $U$ of [Goerss], we'll coequalize two maps:
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
\Palg\otimes S(\LieOperad)V\ar[r]^-{\textup{id}\otimes \textup{frob}}
&%r1c1
\Palg\otimes S(\LieOperad)V\ar@{->>}[r]&%r1c2
\PMonad(S(\LieOperad)V)%r1c3
}\]
and the map $\Palg\otimes S(\LieOperad)V\to\PMonad (S(\LieOperad)V)$ whose restriction to each subset $\Palg\otimes (S(\LieOperad)V)^r$ is the composite
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
\Palg\otimes (S(\LieOperad)V)^r\ar[r]^-{\textup{mult}_{P^r}\otimes\textup{id}}
&
\Palg\otimes (S(\LieOperad)V)^r\ar@{^{(}->}[r]
&%r1c1
\Palg\otimes S(\LieOperad)V\ar@{->>}[r]&%r1c2
\PMonad(S(\LieOperad)V)%r1c3
}\]
One can check, using Goerss' description of the monad $U$, that it can be described by the coequaliser in $\vect{+}{0}$:
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
\Palg\otimes S(\LieOperad)V\ar@<.5ex>[r]\ar@<-.5ex>[r]
&%r1c1
\PMonad(S(\LieOperad)V)\ar@{->>}[r]
&%r1c2
UV%r1c3
}\]
The functor $U$ becomes a monad using the commutation relations given by Goerss, so that all of $U,\PMonad,S(\LieOperad),\Lambda(\LieOperad)$ are monads on graded vector spaces $\vect{+}{0}$. Note further that there is a natural isomorphism of functors $Q_P\circ U=\Lambda(\LieOperad)$. Finally, we note that the monad $U$ posesses a weight grading, analogous to that on the $\delta$-operations used also by [Goerss], the quadratic grading.

We will use the standard simplicial bar construction as our simplicial resolution of $X\in\calW$, writing $B^\calW_sX=U^{s+1}X$. Then the cohomology of $X$, $H^{s}_t(X)\in\vect{1}{+}$, is the cohomology of the cochain complex
\[C^{s}_{t}=\Hom(N_s(Q_\calW B_{\bullet}X)^{t},\F_2).\]
We'll frequently use the identification $Q_\calW B_{s}X=U^{s}X$.

\section{Cohomology operations for unstable Lie algebras over $P$}
\subsection{$\delta$ operations on $H^*_{\calW}$}
\todoeasy{Define the operations $\gamma_i$, state and define the $\delta_i$ operations}{still need to clarify the end of the proof of the relations.}
For $V^{*}\in \vect{+}{0}$, we will define natural homomorphisms
\[\gamma^i:(UV)^{n+i+1}\to V^{n}, \textup{ for $2\leq i<n$}.\]
Indeed, there are natural maps
\begin{align*}
P^i:V^{n}&\to UV^{n+i+1,(2)}, \textup{\quad  for $2\leq i<n$}\\
[\,,]:V^{n_1}\otimes V^{n_2}&\to UV^{n_1+n_2+1,(2)},
\end{align*}
and for given $m\geq1$, the quadratic grading 2 part of $UV^m$ decomposes as
%\[UV^{m,(2)}=\left(\bigoplus_{n_1+n_2=m-1}\im ([\,,]_{n_1,n_2})\right) \oplus\left(\bigoplus_{2\leq i< (m-1)/2}\im (P^i_{m-i-1})\right)\]
%
\[UV^{m,(2)}=\left(\bigoplus_{n_1+n_2=m-1}\im (V^{n_1}\otimes V^{n_2}\overset{[,]}{\to} UV)\right) \oplus\left(\bigoplus_{2\leq i< (m-1)/2}\im (V_{m-i-1}\overset{P^i}{\to}UV)\right).\]
Moreover, the map $P^i:V^n\to UV^{n+i+1,(2)}$ is an isomorphism onto its image, so that for $2\leq i <n$ we may construct $\gamma^i$ as the composite
\[\gamma^i:\left((UV)^{n+i+1}\overset{\textup{proj}}{\makebox[.06ex][l]{$\to$}\to} (UV)^{n+i+1,(2)}\overset{\textup{proj}}{\makebox[.06ex][l]{$\to$}\to} \im (P^i)\overset{(P^i)^{-1}}{\to}V^{n}\right).\]
Here we have projected onto the quadratic filtration 2 part, and then further onto the relevant summand in its natural decomposition. Note that although $P^n:V^n\to UV^{2n+1}$ is a nontrivial map, its image is entangled with the image of the bracket, and we are not able to split it off. Thus we are not able to improve on the bounds $2\leq i< n$.
\begin{prop}
There are natural operations $\delta_i:H^{s}_tW\to H^{s+1}_{t+i+1}W$ defined whenever $2\leq i <t$. If $\alpha\in C^{s}_t$ is a cocycle, $\delta_i\alpha$ is the composite
\[N_{s+1}(Q_U B_{\bullet}W)^{t+i+1}\overset{\gamma^i}{\to}N_s(Q_U B_{\bullet}W)^{t}\overset{\alpha}{\to}\F_2,\]
after identifying $Q_U B_{s+1}W$ with $U^{s}W$ and $Q_U B_{s}W$ with $U^{s+1}W$. These operations satisfy the Adem relation (see Dwyer) for $\delta$ operations.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
One needs to see that $\gamma^i$ is a chain homomorphism respecting the normalisation functor:\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
N_{s+1}(Q_U B_{\bullet}W)^{t+i+1}\ar[r]^-{\gamma^i}
\ar[d]^-{\partial}&%r1c1
N_s(Q_U B_{\bullet}W)^{t}
\ar[d]^-{\partial}
\\%r1c2
N_{s}(Q_U B_{\bullet}W)^{t+i+1}\ar[r]^-{\gamma^i}&%r2c1
N_{s-1}(Q_U B_{\bullet}W)^{t}%r2c2
}\]
For this, it is enough to produce commuting squares:
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
(U^sW)^{t+i+1}\ar[r]^-{\gamma^i}
\ar[d]^-{d_0+d_1}&%r1c1
(U^{s-1}W)^{t}
\ar[d]^-{d_0}
\\%r1c2
(U^{s-1}W)^{t+i+1}\ar[r]^-{\gamma^i}&%r2c1
(U^{s-2}W)^{t}%r2c2
}\]
and for $j\geq1$:
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
(U^sW)^{t+i+1}\ar[r]^-{\gamma^i}
\ar[d]^-{d_{j+1}}&%r1c1
(U^{s-1}W)^{t}
\ar[d]^-{d_j}
\\%r1c2
(U^{s-1}W)^{t+i+1}\ar[r]^-{\gamma^i}&%r2c1
(U^{s-2}W)^{t}%r2c2
}\]
The later squares are easy, and and for the first one, starting with $f_{(s)}g_{(s-1)}h_{(s-2)}\in U^sW$, we find $\gamma^i d_0=u(f)\gamma^i (g)(h_{(s-2)})$,
$\gamma^i d_1=\gamma^i (fg)(h_{(s-2)})$, and
$d_0\gamma^i =\gamma^i (f)u(g)(h_{(s-2)})$. These three quanitities sum to zero, as the single operation $P^i$ is indecomposable. This proves the well-definedness of these operations.

What remains is to check that the Adem relations are satisfied. The necessary argument is a modification of that given in Priddy's work [Koszul], which accommodates for the presence of the extra operations. As the algebra of $\delta$-operations is Koszul dual (in Priddy's sense) to $\Palg$, the Adem relations follow. [$\diamondsuit$ Should I include the compression to the quadratic grading 2 parts?]% For this, show that we can compress to the terms in which there is quadratic grading 2 in each construction. Then the Adem relation is the image under the differential of something obvious.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Steenrod operations and a commutative product for $H^*_{\calW}$}
\todoeasy{Define and state $\Sq$ operations and products}{Need to define $j:Q(X\wedge Y)\to QX\otimes QY$}
We'll now give a construction of operations on the homology $H^*_{\calW}$ which arise from the Lie structure on elements of $\calW$. We'll follow the framework set out by Goerss in the derivation [] of the $\calW$ structure operations on Andre-Quillen homology. The first construction is that of the smash product of objects $X_1,X_2\in\calW$, which is defined to be the kernel of the natural map from the coproduct $X_1\sqcup X_2$ to the product $X_1\times X_2$, so that there is a short exact sequence:
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
0\ar[r]
&%r1c1
X_1\wedge X_2\ar[r]
&%r1c2
X_1\sqcup X_2\ar[r]
&%r1c3
X_1\times X_2\ar[r]&0.
}\]
We leave the interested reader to verify:
\begin{lem}
There is a unique map $j_\calW:Q(X_1\wedge X_2)^t\to (QX_1\otimes QX_2)^{t-1}$ such that
\[P^{i_1}\cdots P^{i_r}[z_1,\cdots ,z_a]\overset{j_\calW}{\mapsto}\begin{cases}
z_1\otimes z_2,&\textup{if }r=0,\,a=2,\,z_1\in X_1\textup{ and } z_2\in X_2,
\\0,&\textup{otherwise, }
\end{cases}
\]
where each of $z_1,\ldots,z_a$ is an element of either $X_1$ or $X_2$, and $[z_1,\ldots,z_s]$ represents some choice of bracketing. It is natural in $X_1$ and $X_2$.
\end{lem}
Next, if $X_\bullet\in s\calW$ is an almost free simplicial object, there is a cogroup object structure $\phi_s:X_s\to X_s\sqcup X_s$ on each level $X_s$ induced by the diagonal map $V_s\to V_s\oplus V_s$ of the generating subspace $V_s$. Write $\overline{\xi}_\calW$ for the difference of the maps $(d_0\sqcup d_0)\phi_s$ and $\phi_{s-1}d_0$ in the group $\textup{Hom}_\calW(X_s,X_{s-1}\sqcup X_{s-1})$. Then $\overline{\xi}_\calW$ factors through a unique map $\xi_\calW:X_s\to X_{s-1}\wedge X_{s-1}$, and one can verify:
\begin{lem}
The map $Q_\calW\xi_\calW$ induces a chain map of (lower) degree $-1$ on normalised complexes:
\[N_s(Q_{\calW}X_\bullet)^t\to N_{s-1}(Q_{\calW}(X_\bullet\wedge X_\bullet))^t.\]
\end{lem}
We now have access to the composite
\[\psi_\calW:\left(N_s(Q_{\calW}X_\bullet)^t\overset{Q_\calW\xi_\calW}{\to} N_{s-1}(Q_{\calW}(X_\bullet\wedge X_\bullet))^t\overset{j_\calW}{\to} N_{s-1}(Q_{\calW}X_\bullet\otimes Q_\calW X_\bullet)^{t-1}\right),\]
which is in fact symmetric, giving a map
\[\psi_{\calW}:N_s(Q_{\calW}X_\bullet)^t\to N_{s-1}(S^2(Q_{\calW}X_\bullet))^{t-1}.\]

From this map we can construct Steenrod operations and a commutative product on the cohology groups $H^*_\calW X$. Explicitly, there are natural homomorphisms
\[\Sq^j:H_t^{s}X\to H_{2t+1}^{s+j}X,\]
defined as follows. Suppose that $\alpha\in C_t^{s}$ is a cocycle. Then we define $\Sq^j\alpha$ as the composite
\[N_{s+j}(Q_UB_{\bullet}X)^{2t+1}\overset{\psi_\calW}{\to}N_{s+j-1}((Q_UB_{\bullet}X)^{\otimes2})^{2t}\overset{\mathbb{D}_{s-j+1}}{\to}
((N_*Q_UB_{\bullet}X)^{\otimes2})^{2t}_{2s}\overset{\alpha\otimes\alpha}{\to}\F_2.
\]
Another way to say this, in the style of Goerss (and others), is to define a function
\[\Theta^j:C_{t}^{s}\to C_{2t+1}^{s+j+1},\ \ \Theta^j(\alpha)=\psi^*_\calW\mathbb{D}_{s-j+1}^*(\alpha\otimes\alpha)+ \psi^*_\calW\mathbb{D}_{s-j+2}^*(\alpha\otimes d\alpha).\]
Note the shift of one in the indices in this formula, as compared with similar formulae [Goerss or Dwyer].
Then, (like Goerss shows), $d\Theta^j\alpha=\Theta^jd\alpha$, and we can define $\Sq^j$ to be the map on cohomotopy defined by $\Theta^j$. Similarly, we can define a cochain complex homomorphism
\[\Psi:C_t^{s}\otimes C_{t'}^{s'}\to C_{t+t'+1}^{s+s'+1}\]
by the formula $\psi^*_\calW\mathbb{D}_0^*$, and use this to define a pairing of cohomology.
\begin{thm}
These operations satisfy the Axioms *write them out*.
\end{thm}
This theorem follows from theorem [BLAH] in the appendix, after the following observation. 

An object of $\calW$ is in particular a $\PMonad$-module, and (as all of the $P$ operations are linear), we can define a functor $Q_{\PMonad}:\calW\to\vect{+}{0}$ by quotienting by the image of these operations. Writing $\calL$ for the category of (good) Lie algebras in $\vect{+}{0}$, one may check:
\begin{lem}
For $X\in\calW$, the vector space $Q_{\PMonad}(X)$ inherits the structure of an object of $\calL$ from the bracket of $X$, yielding a factorization:% of indecomposable functors, $Q_{\calW(n)}=Q_{\calL(n)}\circ Q_{\LambdaMonad(n)}$
\[Q_{\calW}=Q_{\calL}\circ Q_{\PMonad}:\left(\calW\to \calL\to \vect{+}{0}\right).\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
One checks that the bracket is well defined in the quotient, and that taking the quotient by the top $P$ operation imposes the relation $[x,x]=0$ in the resulting Lie algebra, which is thus a good Lie algebra.
\end{proof}
%The functor $Q_\calW:\calW\to \vect{+}{0}$ may be written as a composite of two functors:
%\[\calW\overset{Q_\Palg}{\to}\Lambda(\LieOperad)\textup{-mod}\overset{Q_{\LieOperad}}{\to}\vect{+}{0},\]
%where the functor $Q_\Palg$ takes the quotient by the image of every $P$-operation. It follows from the axioms in $\calW$ that this quotient bears the structure of a (good) Lie algebra. 
Moreover, the simplicial Lie algebra $Q_\PMonad B_\bullet X$ is an almost free simplicial Lie algebra, so that the dual homotopy of $Q_\calW B_\bullet X=Q_{\LieOperad} Q_\PMonad B_\bullet X$ is an instance of Lie algebra cohomology. \textbf{Is this exactly true? It doesn't matter much if not... just need to give extensive enough calculation in the appendix}

By [Priddy's prim coh ops], Lie algebra cohomology has Steenrod operations and a product. However, the formulae given by Priddy (involving the $\overline{W}$-construction) are not obviously equivalent to what we have given here. However, it is not hard to check that the definition we have given using $\psi_\calW$ is equivalent to an analogous definition for Lie algebra cohomology (given in [placemarker in appendix]), and theorem [BLAH again] identifies these operations with Priddy's.

{\tiny
We can identify the bar construction $Q_UB_sX$ with
$Q_{\Lambda(\LieOperad)}\Lambda(\LieOperad)U^sX$,
which is $Q_{\Lambda(\LieOperad)}$ applied to the almost free simplicial Lie algebra $\Lambda(\LieOperad)U^sX$. As such, its homotopy has operations induced by the map
\[\xi_\LieOperad:\left(Q_{\Lambda(\LieOperad)}\Lambda(\LieOperad)U^{s+1}X
\overset{Q(d_0\sqcup d_0\psi+\psi d_0)}{\to}
Q_{\Lambda(\LieOperad)}((\Lambda(\LieOperad)U^sX)^{\wedge2})\overset{j}{\to}
(Q_{\Lambda(\LieOperad)}\Lambda(\LieOperad)U^sX)^{\otimes2}\right)\]
where by $d_0$ we mean the map $\Lambda(\LieOperad)(P\circ S(\LieOperad)/\sim)\to \Lambda(\LieOperad)$ arising from killing the $P$ part and identifying all the Lie stuff together. This only sees the Lie stuff, not the part that has any $P$ in it. Thus it could be written as $f(g)\mapsto q^\LieOperad(f)(g)$.

The operations $\Sq^j:H_t^{s}X\to H_{2t+1}^{s+j}X$ are defined as follows. Suppose that $\alpha\in C_t^{s}$ is a cocycle. Then we define $\Sq^j\alpha$ as the composite
\[N_{s+j}(Q_UB_{\bullet}X)^{2t+1}\overset{\xi_\calL}{\to}N_{s+j-1}((Q_UB_{\bullet}X)^{\otimes2})^{2t}\overset{\mathbb{D}_{s-j+1}}{\to}
((N_*Q_UB_{\bullet}X)^{\otimes2})^{2t}_{2s}\overset{\alpha\otimes\alpha}{\to}\F_2.
\]
Another way to say this, in the style of Goerss (and others), is to define a function
\[\Theta^j:C_{t}^{s}\to C_{2t+1}^{s+j+1},\ \ \Theta^j(\alpha)=\phi^*_\calL\mathbb{D}_{s-j+1}^*(\alpha\otimes\alpha)+ \phi^*_\calL\mathbb{D}_{s-j+2}^*(\alpha\otimes d\alpha).\]
Then, (like Goerss shows), $d\Theta^j\alpha=\Theta^jd\alpha$, and we can define $\Sq^j$ to be the map on cohomotopy defined by $\Theta^j$. Similarly, we can define a cochain complex homomorphism
\[\Psi:C_t^{s}\otimes C_{t'}^{s'}\to C_{t+t'+1}^{s+s'+1}\]
by the formula $\psi^*_\calL\mathbb{D}_0^*$, and use this to define a pairing of cohomology.
\begin{prop}
There are natural homomorphisms
\[\Sq^j:H_t^{s}X\to H_{2t+1}^{s+j}X,\]
zero unless $3\leq j\leq s+1$, and satisfying the Adem relations for the Steenrod algebra. There is a natural nonunital commutative algebra pairing
\[H_t^{s}X\otimes H_{t'}^{s'}X\to H_{t+t'+1}^{s+s'+1}X.\]
These satisfy an unstableness condition:
\[x^2=\Sq^{s+1}x\text{ for }x\in H^{s}_tX\]
and the standard Cartan formula:
\[\Sq^k(xy)=\sum_{i=0}^k(\Sq^ix)(\Sq^{k-i}y).\]

\section{Unstable Lie algebras over the $\Lambda$-algebra}
\todoeasy{Define the categories $\calW(n)$, $\calL(n)$ ($n=0$ is Goerss' case)}{$\calW(n)$ and $\calL(n)$ are monadic over $\vect{+}{n}$, but we won't carefully describe the monads.
\item note that partially restricted Lie algs will appear in the appendix}
In preparation for our calculations of cohomology in $\calW$, we introduce here a family of algebraic categories of a similar nature. That is, we will introduce, for each $n\geq 0$, algebraic categories $\calW(n)$ and $\calL(n)$, such that $\calW(0)=\calW$, and for each $n\geq0$:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item objects of $\calW(n)$ and $\calL(n)$ are $\vect{+}{n}$-graded;
\item the indecomposables functor $Q_{\calW(n)}:\calW(n)\to \vect{+}{n}$ factors through the indecomposables functor $Q_{\calL(n)}:\calL(n)\to \vect{+}{n}$; and
\item the category $\calW(n+1)$ is equivalent to the category $\calL(n)\PiAlg$ of algebras for the homotopy operations of an object of $s\calL(n)$.
\end{itemize}
The definitions of the categories $\calW(n)$ for $n\geq1$ are all of a similar flavor, and a little different to the definition above of $\calW(0)=\calW$. 

For $n\geq1$, $\calL(n)$ is a category of (good) Lie algebras, with a restriction operation partially defined. An object $Y$ of $\calL(n)$ is a Lie algebra with bracket
\[[\DASH,\DASH]:Y^t_{s_n,\ldots,s_1}\otimes Y^q_{p_n,\ldots,p_1}\to Y^{t+q+1}_{s_n+p_n,\ldots,s_1+p_1}\]
(satisfying the Jacobi identity and $[x,x]=0$ for all $x$), and restriction operations
\[\restn{(\DASH)}:Y_{s_n,\ldots,s_1}^t\to Y_{2s_n,\ldots,2s_1}^{2t+1}\]
defined whenever not all of $s_n,\ldots,s_{1}$ are zero.
For $x,y\in Y^t_{s_n,\ldots,s_1}$ and $z\in Y$ homogeneous, the restriction operations satisfy \[\restn{(x+y)}=\restn{(x)}+\restn{(y)}+[x,y]\textup{ and }[\restn{(x)},z]=[x,[x,z]].\]
We have defined the bracket and restrictions on homogeneous elements only, but there is no problem extending these operations to non-homogeneous elements using the bilinearity of the bracket and the above formula for the restriction of a sum.


Building on this definition, an object $X$ of the category $\calW(n)$ is to be an object of $\calL(n)$ admitting certain unstable right $\Lambda$ operations. Namely, whenever $0\leq i\leq s_n$ and not all of $i,s_{n-1},\ldots,s_{1}$ are zero, there is defined an operation
\[(\DASH)\lambda_i:X^t_{s_n,\ldots,s_1}\to X^{2t+1}_{s_n+i,2s_{n-1},\ldots,2s_1}.\]
%The operation $(\DASH)\lambda_i$ is required to be linear whenever $i< s_n$, and 
When $i=s_n$ (and $\lambda_i$ is defined) it is required to equal the restriction:
\[(\DASH)\lambda_{s_n}=\restn{(\DASH)}:X^t_{s_n,\ldots,s_1}\to X^{2t+1}_{2s_n,2s_{n-1},\ldots,2s_1}.\]
In particular, we have already specified that this top $\lambda$-operation is a quadratic refinement \textbf{(acceptable language?)} of the bracket, and how the two operations interact [label that equation]. Contrastingly, the non-top operations are required to be linear, and to be killed by the bracket, so that for any $x,y\in X^t_{s_n,\ldots,s_1}$ and $i<s_n$ (with not all of $i,s_{n-1},\ldots,s_{1}$ being zero) and homogeneous $z\in L$:
\[(x+y)\lambda_i=(x)\lambda_i+(y)\lambda_i\textup{ and }[(x)\lambda_i,z]=0.\]
Finally, these right operations satisfy the $\lambda$-Adem relations. That is, whenever $i>2j$, and $x$ is a homogeneous element of $X$ with $((x)\lambda_j)\lambda_i$ defined:
\[((x)\lambda^j)\lambda^i=\sum_{k=0}^{(i-2j)/2-1}{i-2j-2-k\choose k}((x)\lambda^{i-j-1-k})\lambda^{2j+1+k}.\]

Next, we'll define another category, $\LambdaMonad(n)$, whose objects are $\vect{+}{n}$-graded vector spaces with certain unstable $\lambda$ operations. An object $X$ of $\LambdaMonad(n)$ is simply an object of $\vect{+}{n}$ with operations
\[(\DASH)\lambda_i:X^t_{s_n,\ldots,s_1}\to X^{2t+1}_{s_n+i,2s_{n-1},\ldots,2s_1}\]
defined whenever $0\leq i< s_n$ and not all of $i,s_{n-1},\ldots,s_{1}$ are zero. Note the strict inequality $i<s_n$, so that we define all the $\lambda$ operations except for the top $\lambda$ operation. These operations are all assumed to be linear and to satisfy the same $\lambda$-Adem relation.

The objects of $\calW(n)$ may be described as those graded vector spaces with both $\calL(n)$ and $\LambdaMonad(n)$ structure satisfying certain compatibilities. In fact, it is not difficult to show that the free $\calW(n)$ object monad factors as a composite
\[F_{\calW(n)}=\LambdaMonad(n)\circ F_{\calL(n)}:\vect{+}{n}\to \vect{+}{n},\]
and that the monad structure on $F_{\calW(n)}$ arises from a distributive law [{\tiny Beck Dist Laws in seminar on triples and cat homology thy}]. It is important to note that this is monadic down only as far as $\vect{+}{n}$. In particular, we may define a functor $Q_{\LambdaMonad(n)}:\calW(n)\to\vect{+}{n}$, by quotienting by the image of the \emph{non-top} $\lambda$-operations (which, fortunately, are linear). It follows from the axioms in $\calW(n)$ that:
\begin{lem}
For $X\in\calW(n)$, the vector space $Q_{\LambdaMonad(n)}(X)$ inherits the structure of an object of $\calL(n)$ from the bracket and restriction of $X$, yielding a factorization:% of indecomposable functors, $Q_{\calW(n)}=Q_{\calL(n)}\circ Q_{\LambdaMonad(n)}$
\[Q_{\calW(n)}=Q_{\calL(n)}\circ Q_{\LambdaMonad(n)}:\left(\calW(n)\to \calL(n)\to \vect{+}{n}\right).\]
Moreover the composite $Q_{\LambdaMonad(n)}\circ F_{\calW(n)}$ equals the the free construction $F_{\calL(n)}$.
\end{lem}

\subsection{Vertical steenrod operations for $H^*_{\calW(n)}$, $n\geq1$}\label{section: vertical Koszul operations n positive}
Fix $n\geq1$. For $V\in \vect{+}{n}$, we will define natural homomorphisms
\[\gamma_i:(F_{\calW(n)}V)^{2t+1}_{s_n+i-1,2s_{n-1},\ldots,2s_1}\to V^{t}_{s_n,\ldots,s_1},\]
whenever $1\leq i \leq s_n$ and not all of $i-1,s_{n-1},\ldots,s_1$ are zero.
{\tiny Meh: These are rather easier to define than in the $n=0$ case above, as the monad $F_{\calW(n)}$ is a simple composite of monads.}
Indeed, there are natural monomorphisms
\[(\DASH)\lambda_{i-1}:V^{t}_{s_n,\ldots,s_1}\to (F_{\calW(n)}V)^{2t+1,(2)}_{s_n+i-1,2s_{n-1},\ldots,2s_1}\]
defined whenever $1\leq i\leq n$ and $i-1,s_{n-1},\ldots,s_1$ are not all zero, and an inclusion
\[\textup{incl}:(F_{\calL(n)}V)^{*,(2)}\to F_{\calW(n)}V^{*,(2)}.\]
As in the $n=0$ case, the images of the listed maps are linearly independent and span the quadratic grading 2 part of $F_{\calW(n)}V^*$. We define $\gamma_i$ as before --- project onto the quadratic grading 2 part, then further onto the summand corresponding to the image of $\lambda_{i-1}$, and finally use the inverse of the map $\lambda_{i-1}$:
\[\gamma_i:\left((F_{\calW(n)}V)^{2t+1}_{s_n+i-1,2s_{n-1},\ldots,2s_1}\overset{\textup{proj}\circ\textup{proj}}{\makebox[.06ex][l]{$\to$}\to} \im (\lambda_{i-1})\overset{(\lambda_{i-1})^{-1}}{\to}V^{t}_{s_{n,\ldots,s_1}}\right).\]
\begin{prop}
There are natural operations
\[\Sq_\textup{v}^i:(H^*_{\calW(n)}X)^{s_{n+1},\ldots,s_1}_t\to (H^*_{\calW(n)}X)^{s_{n+1}+1,s_n+i-1,2s_{n-1},\ldots,2s_1}_{2t+1}\]
defined whenever $1\leq i \leq s_n$ and not all of $i-1,s_{n-1},\ldots,s_1$ are zero. If $\alpha\in C^{s_{n+1},\ldots,s_1}_t$ is a cocycle, $\Sq_\textup{v}^i\alpha$ is the composite
\[N_{s_{n+1}+1}(Q_U B_{\bullet}X)^{2t+1}_{s_{n}+i-1,2s_{n-1},\ldots,2s_1}\overset{\gamma_i}{\to}N_{s_{n+1}}(Q_U B_{\bullet}X)^{t}_{s_{n},s_{n-1},\ldots,s_1}\overset{\alpha}{\to}\F_2,\]
after identifying $Q_U B_{s+1}X$ with $U^{s}X$ and $Q_U B_{s}X$ with $U^{s+1}X$. These operations satisfy the Adem relation for Steenrod operations.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The proof here is obtained by modification of the corresponding proof in the $n=0$ case. Note that we use the Koszul duality between the Steenrod and $\Lambda$ algebras (Priddy Koszul Resolutions). \textbf{One might} make a note of the fact that all of the necessary relation terms are actually available --- nothing is ruled out due to dimension issues.

\begin{Composite functor spectral sequences}
\vfil\pagebreak
\section{Composite functor spectral sequences}
The subject of this paper is to identify the derived functors $H^*_{\calW(0)}X:=(\mathbb{L}_*Q_{\calW(0)}X)^*$, for $X\in\calW(0)$. More generally, we'll now present a spectral sequence that may be used to calculate $H^*_{\calW(n)}X$ for $X\in\calW(n)$. This will a composite functor spectral sequence analogous to Miller's spectral sequence in []. The factorization of $Q_{\calW(n)}$ we will use is of course 
\[Q_{\calW(n)}=\left(\calW(n)\overset{Q_{\calU(n)}}{\to}\calL(n)\overset{Q_{\calL(n)}}{\to}\vect{+}{n}\right)\]
There is an added challenge in this context --- indeed, the available factorization of $Q_{\calW(n)}$ is through a non-abelian category. Thus, the standard technology for composite functor spectral sequences does not apply, and we must use Blanc and Stover's methods []. They observe that the left derived functors $\mathbb{L}_*Q_{\calU(n)}X$ are calculated as the homotopy groups of a simplicial object in $\calL(n)$, namely $Q_{\calU(n)}B_\bullet^{\calW(n)}X$. As such, they have the structure of a $\calL(n)\textup{-$\Pi$-algebra}$, i.e.\ they form an object of $\calW(n+1)$.  After verifying that the functor $Q_{\calU(n)}$ satisfies the requisite acyclicity condition (indeed it preserves free objects), one may apply [relevant BS theorem]: there is a spectral sequence, with $E_r\in\vect{+}{n+2}$,
\[(E_2)_{s_{n+2},\ldots,s_1}^t=((H_*^{\calW(n+1)})(\mathbb{L}_*Q_{\calU(n)})X)_{s_{n+2},\ldots,s_1}^t\implies ((H_*^{\calW(n)})X)_{s_{n+2}+s_{n+1},s_n,\ldots,s_1}^t\]
We'll prefer to work with the dual spectral sequence, (which is equivalent, as we have specified that elements of $\calW(n)$ are locally finite), which has $E^r\in\vect{n+2}{+}$:
\[(E^2)^{s_{n+2},\ldots,s_1}_t=((H^*_{\calW(n+1)})(\mathbb{L}_*Q_{\calU(n)})X)^{s_{n+2},\ldots,s_1}_t\implies ((H^*_{\calW(n)})X)^{s_{n+2}+s_{n+1},s_n,\ldots,s_1}_t\]
These are the homology and cohomology spectral sequences for a bisimplicial abelian group (precisely, an object of $ss\vect{+}{n}$), and we will need to work with this object directly. Before we do, we'll give some general recollections and constructions relevant to the spectral sequence.

\subsection{The Blanc-Stover comonad in categories monadic over $\F_2$-vector spaces}
Fix an algebraic category $\calC$, monadic over $\vect{}{}$ (more generally, monadic over some category of graded vector spaces, but for now we opt for notational simplicity). As we are working over a category of vector spaces, we can refine Blanc and Stover's definition \cite{Blanc_Stover-Groth_SS.pdf} of a useful comonad `$W$' on $s\calC$. (Did I end up changing the character for this?)

It will help to fix a little notation. First, for $n\geq0$, let $\mathbb{S}^n\in \textup{ch}_+ \vect{}{}$ and $C\mathbb{S}^n\in \textup{ch}_+ \vect{}{}$ be the chain complexes
\[(\mathbb{S}^n)_j=\begin{cases}
\F_2\langle z\rangle,&\textup{if }j=n;\\
0,&\textup{otherwise},
\end{cases}\qquad 
(C\mathbb{S}^n)_j=\begin{cases}
\F_2\langle h\rangle,&\textup{if }j=n+1;\\
\F_2\langle dh\rangle,&\textup{if }j=n;\\
0,&\textup{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\]
%with $d:(C\mathbb{S}^n)_{n+1}\to (C\mathbb{S}^n)_{n}$ the identity of $\F_2$.
There is an evident inclusion $\imath:\mathbb{S}\to C\mathbb{S}$. For any $V\in\textup{ch}_+\vect{}{}$, we have
\[\hom_{\textup{ch}_+\vect{}{}}(\mathbb{S}^n,V)\cong ZN_nV,\textup{ and }\hom_{\textup{ch}_+\vect{}{}}(C\mathbb{S}^n,V)\cong N_{n+1}V,\]
and the differential $d:N_{n+1}V\to ZN_nV$ corresponds to $\imath^*$ under these isomorphisms. If $N:s\vect{}{}\rightleftarrows \textup{ch}_+ \vect{}{}
:\Gamma$ are the inverse equivalences of the Dold-Kan correspondence, define
\[S^n_{\calC}:=F_{\calC}\Gamma(\mathbb{S}^n)\textup{ and }CS^n_{\calC}:=F_{\calC}\Gamma(C\mathbb{S}^n).\]
Corresponding to the above structure, $S^n_{\calC}$ contains an element $z$ in dimension $n$, $CS^n_{\calC}$ contains an element $h$ in dimension $n+1$, there is a map $\imath:S^n_{\calC}\to CS^n_{\calC}$ sending $z$ to $d_0h$. For $L\in s\calC$, $\imath^*$ represents the differential under the isomorphisms
\[\hom_{s\calC}(S_\calC^n,L)\cong ZN_nL,\textup{ and }\hom_{s\calC}(CS_\calC^n,L)\cong N_{n+1}L.\]

In this context, Blanc-Stover's comonad $\BSW$, applied to $L\in s\calC$, is the pushout
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
\bigsqcup_{n\geq0}\bigsqcup_{N_{n+1}L}S_\calC^n
\ar[r]\ar[d]^-{\bigsqcup\bigsqcup\imath}
&%r1c1
\bigsqcup_{n\geq0}\bigsqcup_{ZN_{n}L}S_\calC^n\ar[d]\\%r1c2
\bigsqcup_{n\geq0}\bigsqcup_{N_{n+1}L}CS_\calC^n
\ar[r]&%r2c1
\BSW L%r2c2
}\]
where under the top horizontal map, the copy of $S^n_\calC$ corresponding to $x\in N_{n+1}L$ maps identically onto the copy of $S^n_\calC$ corresponding to $dx=\imath^*x$. It will be useful to write $h_x$ for the element of $\BSW L$ corresponding to $h$ in the copy of $CS^n_\calC$ corresponding to $x\in N_{n+1}L$, and similarly, $z_x$ for the element of $\BSW L$ corresponding to $z$ in the copy of $S^n_\calC$ corresponding to $x\in ZN_{n}L$. The comonad structure maps $\epsilon:\BSW L\to L$ and $\Delta:\BSW L\to \BSW^2L$ are then determined by the equations
\[\epsilon(h_x)=x,\ \epsilon(z_y)=y,\ \Delta(h_x)=h_{h_x},\textup{ and }\Delta(z_y)=z_{z_y}\textup{ for $x\in N_{n+1}L$ and $y\in ZN_nL$.}\]

Moreover, $\BSW L$ is homotopy equivalent to a coproduct of spheres. Indeed, for each $n$, let $B_nL=\im (d:N_{n+1}L\to ZN_nL)$, and choose a section $h_0$ of the surjection $d:N_{n+1}L\to B_nL$. Then $\BSW L$ contains the contractible subobject $C_0:=\bigsqcup_n\bigsqcup_{h\in \im (h_0)} CS^n_{h_0(f)}$, and $\BSW L/C_0$ is homotopic to a wedge of spheres:
%\[\BSW L/C_0\cong \left(\bigsqcup_{h\in N_{n+1}L\setminus\im (h_0)}CS^n_h/\partial(CS^n_h)\right) \sqcup\left(\bigsqcup_{f\in ZN_nL\setminus B_nL}S^n_f\right)\]
\[\BSW L/C_0\cong \left(\bigsqcup_{N_{n+1}L\setminus\im (h_0)}F_\calC (CS^n_{\vect{}{}}/\partial(CS^n_{\vect{}{}}))\right) \sqcup\left(\bigsqcup_{f\in ZN_nL\setminus B_nL}S^n_\calC\right)\]
We would like to find a \emph{subspace} of $\pi_*(\BSW L)$ which freely generates it as a $\calC\textup{-$\Pi$-algebra}$. Even better, we have the following rendition of [Stover? Blanc-Stover?]. We give the proof since we will need to be explicit about some parts of it in what follows.
\begin{prop}
For $L\in\calC$, $\pi_*(B_\bullet^{\BSW}L)$ is an almost free (monadic over $\vect{}{}$) simplicial $\calC\textup{-$\Pi$-algebra}$ weakly equivalent to $\pi_*(L)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
That the augmentation to $\pi_*(L)$ is a weak equivalence follows from Stover's result \cite[2.7]{StoverVanKampen.pdf}. The only change from Blanc-Stover is that $\pi_*(B_\bullet^{\BSW}L)$ is almost free over the category $\vect{}{}$, rather than the category of pointed sets.
For a set $S$, write $\F_2\langle S\rangle$ for the vector space generated by the symbols $\underline{s}$ for $s\in S$. There's a natural map $\F_2\langle d\rangle :\F_2\langle N_{n+1}L\rangle \to \F_2\langle ZN_nL\rangle $, and a natural monomorphism $\alpha:\ker(\F_2\langle d\rangle)\to \pi_*(\BSW L)$, defined by
\[\alpha(\underline{x_1}-\underline{x_0})=[h_{x_1}-h_{x_0}],\textup{ for $x_1,x_2\in N_{n+1}L$ with $dx_1=dx_2$}.\]
Moreover, there's a natural map $\beta:\F_2[ZN_nL]\to\pi_*(\BSW L)$ (which is not monomorphic) defined by
\[\beta(\underline{x})=[z_{x}],\textup{ for $x\in ZN_{n}L$}.\]
From the above expression for $\BSW L/C_0$, one sees that $\im (\alpha)$ and $\im (\beta)$ are linearly independent subspaces of $\pi_*(\BSW L)$, and $\pi_*(\BSW L)$ is free on $\im (\alpha)\oplus\im (\beta)$. From this description it is clear that the generating subspaces are preserved by maps in the image of $\BSW $. Thus, every face and degeneracy map except for $s_0$ and $d_0$ preserves the generators.

In order that $s_0$ preserves generators, we note that the diagonal of $\BSW$ sends the subspaces $\im (\alpha_L)$ and $\im (\beta_L)$ into the subspaces $\im (\alpha_{\BSW L})$ and $\im (\beta_{\BSW L})$. That $\im (\beta_L)$ maps into $\im (\beta_{\BSW L})$ is immediate. For $\im (\alpha_L)$, the image of $h_{x_1}-h_{x_0}$ under the diagonal is $h_{h_{x_1}}-h_{h_{x_0}}$, which is in $\im(\alpha_{\BSW L})$, since $dh_{x_1}=z_{dx_1}=z_{dx_0}=dh_{x_0}$.
\end{proof}



%There's a natural map $\F_2[d]:\F_2[N_{n+1}X]\to \F_2[ZN_nX]$, and a natural monomorphism $\alpha:\ker(\F_2[d])\to\pi_*(\BSW X)$. Indeed, writing $\underline{z}$ for the generator of $\F_2[N_{n+1}X]$ corresponding to $z\in N_{{n+1}X}$, the group $\ker(\F_2[d])$ is generated by differences $\underline{z}-\underline{z}'$ for $z,z'\in N_{n+1}X$ having $dz=dz'$, and we define $\alpha(\underline{z}-\underline{z}')$ to be the homotopy class of the difference of the cones corresponding to $z$ and $z'$, whose boundaries have been identified in the colimit. Moreover, there's a natural map $\beta:\F_2[ZN_nX]\to\pi_*(\BSW X)$ (which is not monomorphic), which sends a generator $z\in ZN_nX$ to the homotopy class in $\BSW X$ of the corresponding summand in the top right corner of the colimit diagram. From the above expression for $\BSW X/C_0$, one sees that $\im (\alpha)$ and $\im (\beta)$ are linearly independent subspaces of $\pi_*(\BSW X)$, and $\pi_*(\BSW X)$ is free on $\im (\alpha)\oplus\im (\beta)$. From this description it is clear that the generating subspaces are preserved by maps in the image of $\BSW $.
%
%Moreover, the diagonal of the comonad also preserves the subspaces $\im (\alpha)$ and $\im (\beta)$. That $\im (\alpha)$ is preserved is evident from the definitions. For $\im (\beta)$, note that $\im (\beta)\subset\pi_*(\BSW X)$ is spanned by terms $D_h-D_{h'}$ for $h,h':CS\to X$ satisfying $h\imath=h'\imath$. The diagonal applied to $D_h-D_{h'}$ may be written $D_{D_h}-D_{D_{h'}}$, and one notes that $D_h\imath=S_{h\imath}=S_{h'\imath}=D_{h'}\imath$.
%
%\textbf{Move this para: }Blanc and Stover explain that $\BSW $ actually has the structure of a comonad on $s\calL(n)$. As such, for any simplicial Lie algebra $L_\bullet\in s\calL(n)$, there is a bisimplicial object $B_\bullet^\BSW L_\bullet$, the bar construction using the comonad $\BSW $, given by $B_{s_2}^\BSW L_{s_1}=(\BSW^{s_2+1}L_\bullet)_{s_1}$. Flesh out the point here...
%
%
%Now the utility of the comonad structure lies in resolving an object $L_\bullet\in s\calL(n)$ by the comonadic bar construction, $B^\BSW_\bullet(L_\bullet)$. This discussion shows that, except for $d_0$, all the maps in $B_\bullet^\BSW L_\bullet$ preserve the subspaces of generators of $\pi_*(B_\bullet^\BSW L_\bullet)$, which is to say that this object of $s\calW(n+1)$ is almost free. Moreover, according to [Stover 2.6], the augmentation map $\pi_*(B_\bullet^\BSW L_\bullet)\to \pi_*(L)$ is a weak equivalence in $s\calW(n+1)$. Thus, this Blanc-Stover $\BSW $-construction provides an almost-free replacement of $\pi_*(L)$ in $s\calW(n+1)$.





\subsection{A chain-level diagonal on the $\BSW $ construction}
\label{Subsection: Chain level diagonal}
We have seen, for $L\in s\calC$, that $\pi_*(\BSW L)$ is naturally a free object in $\calC\PiAlg$. As such, there is a diagonal
\[\phi_{\calC\PiAlg}:\pi_*(\BSW L)\to \pi_*(\BSW L)\sqcup \pi_*(\BSW L).\]
In this section, we'll describe how $\phi_{\calC\PiAlg}$ is the map on homotopy induced by a morphism $\phi_\BSW :\BSW L\to \BSW L\sqcup \BSW L$ in $s\calC$ (so that $i\circ\phi_{\calC\PiAlg}=\pi_*(\phi_{\BSW})$, where $i$ is the natural isomorphism $\pi_*(\BSW L)\sqcup\pi_*(\BSW L)\to \pi_*(\BSW L\sqcup \BSW L)$).

In order to construct a map $\phi_\BSW $, we construct a commuting diagram

The maps $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ can then be applied respectively to all of the sphere and cone classes appearing in $\BSW L$.
%In fact, this diagram can even be formed in $s\vect{+}{n}$, before application of $F_{\calC}:\vect{+}{n}\to\calC$, and $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are just the levelwise application of the diagonal map on a simplicial vector space. 
To understand the effect of $\phi_{\BSW }$ on homotopy, it is enough to identify where the generators of $\pi(\BSW L)$ are sent in $\pi(\BSW L)\sqcup\pi(\BSW L)$, which is easy.
\begin{lem}
$\BSW L$ is naturally a (strict) commutative cogroup object, having comultiplication map $\phi_{\BSW }$, counit map $0:\BSW L\to 0$, and inverse map $\textup{id}:\BSW L\to \BSW L$. In particular, $\hom(\BSW L,\DASH)$ takes values in $\ensuremath{\F_2}$-vector spaces.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
There are a few axioms to check, for example, left counitality: that the composite 
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm@1{
\BSW L\ar[r]^-{\phi_{\BSW }}
&%r1c1
\BSW L\sqcup \BSW L\ar[r]^-{\textup{id}\sqcup0}
&%r1c2
\BSW L%r1c3
}\] is the identity. This follows since $(\textup{id}\sqcup0)\phi_1$ is the identity of $S^n$ and $(\textup{id}\sqcup0)\phi_2$ is the identity of $CS^n$. The other axioms follow similarly.
\end{proof}

Using the notation $*$ for the group operation on $\hom_{s\calC}(\BSW L,L')$, we have the following:
\begin{lem}
For maps $f,g:\BSW L\to L'$ we have 
\[Q_{\calC}(f*g)=(Q_{\calC}f+Q_{\calC}g):Q_{\calC}\BSW L\to Q_{\calC}L'.\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
It's enough to check that $Q_{\calC}(\phi_\BSW ):Q_{\calC}\BSW L\to Q_{\calC}(\BSW L\sqcup \BSW L)$ equals the diagonal map $Q_{\calC}\BSW L\to Q_{\calC}\BSW L\oplus Q_{\calC}\BSW L$. For this, $Q_{\calC}$ converts all the colimits involved in the construction of $\BSW L$ to colimits in $s\vect{+}{n}$, and $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are both precisely the diagonal map.
\end{proof}

Now let $\overline{\xi}_{\BSW }$ denote the following composite:
%\[W^2X\overset{\phi_{\BSW }}{\to}(W^2X)^{\sqcup2}\overset{\phi_{\BSW }\sqcup \epsilon}{\to}(W^2X)^{\sqcup2}\sqcup(WX) \overset{\epsilon^{\sqcup2}\sqcup\phi_{ch}}{\to}((WX)^{\sqcup2})^{\sqcup2}\overset{\textup{fold}}{\to}(WX)^{\sqcup2}\]
\[\makebox[0mm][r]{$\overline{\xi}_{\BSW }:\ $}\BSW^2L\overset{\phi_{\BSW }}{\to}(\BSW^2L)^{\sqcup2}\overset{a\sqcup b}{\to}(\BSW L)^{\sqcup2}\]
where $a,b:\BSW^2L\to(\BSW L)^{\sqcup2}$ are the composites
\[\xymatrix@R=2mm{
\makebox[0mm][r]{$a:\ $}\BSW^2L\ar[r]^-{\phi_{\BSW }}
&%r1c1
(\BSW^2L)^{\sqcup2}\ar[r]^-{\epsilon^{\sqcup2}}
&%r1c2
(\BSW L)^{\sqcup2}\\
\makebox[0mm][r]{$b:\ $}\BSW^2L\ar[r]^-{\epsilon}
&%r1c1
(\BSW L)\ar[r]^-{\phi_{\BSW }}
&%r1c2
(\BSW L)^{\sqcup2}
}\]
\begin{lem}
The composite 
$\BSW^2L\overset{\overline{\xi}_{\BSW }}{\to}(\BSW L)^{\sqcup2}\to(\BSW L)^{\times2}$ is zero.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
This follows from the observation that both composites $(\textup{id}\sqcup0)\overline{\xi}_{\BSW }$ and $(0\sqcup\textup{id})\overline{\xi}_{\BSW }$ equal $\epsilon:\BSW^2L\to \BSW L$.
\end{proof}
In particular, $\overline{\xi}_{\BSW }$ factors through the smash product, defining a natural map
\[\xi_{\BSW }:\BSW^2L\to (\BSW L)^{\wedge 2}.\]

\begin{lem}\label{LemmaOn xi}
We have $i\circ \xi_{\calC\PiAlg}=\pi_*(\xi_{\BSW}):\pi_*(\BSW^{p+k+1}L)\to\pi_*((\BSW^{p+k}L)^{\wedge 2})$, where $i$ is the natural isomorphism $(\pi_*(\BSW^{p+k}))^{\wedge 2}\to \pi_*((\BSW^{p+k})^{\wedge 2})$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Given the observation [?from above on SESs], this is equivalent to $i\circ \overline{\xi}_{\calC\PiAlg}=\pi_*(\overline{\xi}_{\BSW}):\pi_*(\BSW^{p+k+1}L)\to\pi_*((\BSW^{p+k}L)^{\sqcup 2})$, which follows from $i\circ\phi_{\calC\PiAlg}=\pi_*(\phi_{\BSW})$.
\end{proof}

%
%
%\[i\circ \overline{\xi}_{\calW(n+1)}=\pi(\overline{\xi}_{\BSW}):\pi(\BSW^{p+k+1}L)\to\pi((\BSW^{p+k}L)^{\sqcup 2}).\]
%This identity reduces to the fact (\S\ref{Subsection: Chain level diagonal}) that $i\circ\phi_{\calC\PiAlg}=\pi_*(\phi_{\BSW})$.

\[N_*N_*(Q_{\calC}B^\BSW_{\bullet}L)_{s_2,s_1}\to

\subsection{Definition of the spectral sequence}
\todo{Give the construction of the spectral sequence}{Do it in general, then in the specific cases
\item Conclude with `we'll now look at some constructions required to give operations on the sseq.'}
Fix $X\in\calW(n)$, and define $L=Q_{\calU(n)}B^\calW(n)X$. Let $\BSWres L$ be the bisimplicial object obtained from the simplicial bar construction using the comonad $\BSW$. Then the spectral sequence we are interested in is the spectral sequence of the bisimplicial object
\[Q_{\calL(n)}\BSWres L.\]
Now $L$ is an almost free object of $\calL(n)$, with $\pi_*L=H_*^{\calU(n)}X$. Thus $\pi_*(\BSWres L)$ is an almost free resolution of $H_*^{\calU(n)}X$ in $s\calW(n+1)$. Moreover, $\pi_*(Q_{\calL(n)}\BSWres L)=Q_{\calW(n+1)}\pi_*(\BSWres L)$, so that
\[E^2_{**}=H_*^{\calW(n+1)}H_*^{\calU(n)}X.\]
\textbf{Some} comments here on the convergence target.

%\subsection{Singer's theory of spectral sequence operations}
\subsection{Spectral sequence operations}
In what follows, we'll need to use Singer's techniques for deriving operations in spectral sequences. He defines operations in the cohomology spectral sequence of a bisimplicial cocommutative coalgebra. While the comultiplicative structure that we can define on the resolution $Q_{\calL(n)}\BSWres L$ is not that of a coalgebra, we can still use his techniques after a single simple observation. That is, for every bisimplicial vector space $V$, if we write $E_r^{**}(V)$ for the cohomology spectral sequence obtained from the double cochain complex $(N_*N_*V)^*$, then Singer's methods yield external operations of type:
\[E_r^{**}(V)\to E_{r'}^{**}(S^2V)\textup{ and }E_r^{**}(V)\otimes E_r^{**}(V)\to E_r^{**}(S^2V),\]
which will be compatible with external operations of type:
\[H^{*}((CV)^*)\to H^{*}((CS^2V)^*)\textup{ and }H^{*}((CV)^*)\otimes H^{*}((CV)^*)\to H^{*}((CS^2V)^*).\]

When $V$ is a cocommutative coalgebra, the diagonal map $V\to S^2V$ induces a map $E_r^{**}(S^2V)\to E_r^{**}(V)$, postcomposition with which yields Singer's operations, however we will not have access to such structure in what follows. Thus, we will briefly reprise Singer's results in this \emph{external} language, in order that we have them available.
\begin{thm}[Singer's Book, thm 2.15-2.17,2.22]
For all $p,q\geq0$ and all $r\geq2$, there are well-defined vector space homomorphisms:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\ExtCohOp^k:E^{p,q}_r(V)&\to E^{p,q+k}_r(S^2V)&\qquad&\text{if }0\leq k \leq q,\\
\ExtCohOp^k:E^{p,q}_r(V)&\to E^{p+k-q,2q}_{r+k-q}(S^2V)&\qquad&\text{if }q\leq k\leq q+r-2,\\
\ExtCohOp^k:E^{p,q}_r(V)&\to E^{p+k-q,2q}_{2r-2}(S^2V)&\qquad&\text{if }q+r-2\leq k.
\end{alignat*}
The operations $\ExtCohOp^k$ are all defined at $E_2$, and determine the operations at each $E_r$, $r>2$. The operations $\ExtCohOp^k$ commute with differentials. Finally, the $\ExtCohOp^k$ converge to well defined maps on $E_\infty$, and there is a commuting diagram
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
E^{p,q}_\infty(V)\ar[r]^-{\ExtCohOp^k}\ar[d]^-{\pi}
&%r1c1
E^{p,q+k}_\infty(S^2V)\ar[d]^-{\pi}
\\%r1c2
E_0^{p,q}H^*((CV)^*)\ar[r]^-{\ExtCohOp^k}&%r2c1
E_0^{p,q+k}H^*((CS^2V)^*)%r2c2
}\]
whenever $0\leq k\leq q$, and a commuting diagram
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
E^{p,q}_\infty(V)\ar[r]^-{\ExtCohOp^k}\ar[d]^-{\pi}
&%r1c1
E^{p+k-q,2q}_\infty(S^2V)\ar[d]^-{\pi}
\\%r1c2
E_0^{p,q}H^*((CV)^*)\ar[r]^-{\ExtCohOp^k}&%r2c1
E_0^{p+k-q,2q}H^*((CS^2V)^*)%r2c2
}\]
whenever $q\leq k$ (which summarises also Singer's computation of how the $\ExtCohOp^k$ interact with the filtation on cohomology).

Similar theory holds for an exterior product operation
\[\ExtCohProd:E_r^{p_1,q_1}(V)\otimes E_r^{p_2,q_2}(V)\to E_r^{p_1+p_2,q_1+p_2}(S^2V)\]
%Moreover, for $r\geq2$ and $p,q,k\geq0$ given, if $\alpha\in E_r^{p,q}$, then $\Sq_\textup{ext}^k\alpha$ and $\Sq_\textup{ext}^kd_r\alpha$ both survive to $E_t$, where
%\[t=\begin{cases}
%r,&\textup{if }0\leq k \leq q-r+1;\\
%2r+k-q-1,&\textup{if }q-r+1\leq k\leq q;
%\\2r-1,&\textup{if }q\leq k,
%\end{cases}
%\]
%and in $E_t$ we have the relation $d_t\Sq^k_textup{ext}\alpha=\Sq^k_textup{ext}d_r\alpha$.
\end{thm}
Moreover, if the bisimplicial object $V$ admits an augmentation $\lambda:V_{0\bullet}\to U_{\bullet}$, then %such that the natural map $\lambda_*:CV\to CU$ is a weak equivalence,
Singer proves the following relationship between the spectral sequence operations and the operations of \S\ref{quadratic part section}:
\begin{thm}[Proposition 2.1]
The $\ExtCohOp^k$ and $\ExtCohProd$ commute with $\lambda^*$, so that there are commuting diagrams
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
H^{m}((CU)^*)\ar[r]^-{\ExtCohOp^k}
\ar[d]^-{\lambda^*}
&%r1c1
H^{m+k}((CS^2U)^*)\ar[d]^-{(S^2\lambda)^*}
&%r1c3
H^{m_1}((CU)^*)\otimes H^{m_2}((CU)^*)\ar[r]^-{\ExtCohProd}
\ar[d]^-{\lambda^*}
&%r1c1
H^{m_1+m_2}((CS^2U)^*)\ar[d]^-{(S^2\lambda)^*}
\\%r1c5
H^{m}((CV)^*)\ar[r]^-{\ExtCohOp^k}
&%r2c1
H^{m+k}((CS^2V)^*)
&%r2c3
H^{m_1}((CV)^*)\otimes H^{m_2}((CV)^*)\ar[r]^-{\ExtCohProd}
&%r2c1
H^{m_1+m_2}((CS^2V)^*)
}\]
\end{thm}

Singer separates the operations $\ExtCohOp^k:E^{p,q}_2\to E_{2}$ according to the pattern of change in the spectral sequence coordinates of their output. Indeed, define
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\vExtCohOp^k=\ExtCohOp^k:E^{p,q}_2(V)&\to E^{p,q+k}_2(S^2V)&\qquad&\text{if }0\leq k \leq q,\\
\hExtCohOp^k=\ExtCohOp^{q+k}:E^{p,q}_2(V)&\to E^{p+k,2q}_2(S^2V)&\qquad&\text{if }0\leq k \leq p,
\end{alignat*}
and gives explicit formulae for these $E_2$ operations, and for the product at $E_2$ [Singer 2.23].


In order to use these constructions in the present work, we will use the map of double complexes:
\[\psi_{\BSW}=j_{\calL(n)}\circ Q_{\calL(n)}\xi_\BSW:N_{p+1}N_q(Q_{\calL(n)}G_{\bullet}L)_{s_n,\ldots,s_1}^{t+1}\to N_{p}N_q(S^2(Q_{\calL(n)}G_{\bullet}L))_{s_n,\ldots,s_1}^{t}\]
to define a spectral sequence map
\[E_2^{p,q}(S^2(Q_{\calL(n)}\BSWres L))^{s_n,\ldots,s_1}_t\overset{(\psi_\BSW)^*}{\to} E_2^{p+1,q}(Q_{\calL(n)}\BSWres L)^{s_n,\ldots,s_1}_{t+1}\]
We may then define internal spectral sequence operations
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\Sq^k=\psi_{\BSW}^*\circ\ExtCohOp^{k-1}:(E^{p,q}_r)^{s_n,\ldots,s_1}_t&\to (E^{p+1,q+k-1}_r)^{2s_n,\ldots,2s_1}_{2t+1}&\qquad&\text{if }0\leq k-1 \leq q,\\
\Sq^k=\psi_{\BSW}^*\circ\ExtCohOp^{k-1}:(E^{p,q}_r)^{s_n,\ldots,s_1}_t&\to (E^{p+k-q,2q}_{r+k-q-1})^{2s_n,\ldots,2s_1}_{2t+1}&\qquad&\text{if }q\leq k-1\leq q+r-2,\\
\Sq^k=\psi_{\BSW}^*\circ\ExtCohOp^{k-1}:(E^{p,q}_r)^{s_n,\ldots,s_1}_t&\to (E^{p+k-q,2q}_{2r-2})^{2s_n,\ldots,2s_1}_{2t+1}&\qquad&\text{if }q+r-2\leq k-1.
\end{alignat*}
Which, at $E_2$, we may write (dropping internal degrees) as \textbf{(precisely?:)}
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\Sq^k_\textup{v}=\psi_{\BSW}^*\circ\vExtCohOp^{k-1}=\psi_{\BSW}^*\circ\ExtCohOp^{k-1}:E^{p,q}_2&\to E^{p+1,q+k-1}_2&\qquad&\text{if }0\leq k-1 \leq q,\\
\Sq^k_\textup{h}=\psi_{\BSW}^*\circ\hExtCohOp^{k-1}=\psi_{\BSW}^*\circ\ExtCohOp^{q+k-1}:E^{p,q}_2&\to E^{p+k,2q}_2&\qquad&\text{if }0\leq k-1 \leq p,
\end{alignat*}

And similarly, a pairing
\[\mu=\psi_{\BSW}^*\circ\ExtCohProd:(E^{p,q}_r)^{s_n,\ldots,s_1}_t\otimes (E^{p',q'}_r)^{s'_n,\ldots,s'_1}_{t'}\to (E^{p+p'+1,q+q'}_r)^{s_n+s'_n,\ldots,s_1+s'_1}_{t+t'+1}\]
The reader might now guess the next results:
\begin{thm}\label{E2CompFuncLieOperationsID}
At $E_2$, the operations $\Sq_\textup{h}^k$ and $\mu$ are equal to the $H^*_{\calW(n+1)}$-cohomology operations on $E_2=H^*_{\calW(n+1)}H_*^{\calU(n)}X$ of the same name, as defined in [\S?].
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}\label{E2CompFuncKosOperationsID}
At $E_2$, the operations $\Sq_\textup{v}^k$ are equal to the $H^*_{\calW(n+1)}$-cohomology operations on $E_2=H^*_{\calW(n+1)}H_*^{\calU(n)}X$ of the same name, as defined in [\S?].
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}\label{EInftyCompFuncOperationsID}
At $E_\infty$, the operations $\Sq^k$ are compatible with the operations $\Sq^k_\textup{h}$ defined on the target $H^*_{\calW(n)}(X)$, as defined in [\S?].
\end{thm} 
\begin{proof}[Proof of \ref{E2CompFuncLieOperationsID}]
We will prove this theorem in various parts. Firstly, we'll work on the operations $\Sq_\textup{h}^k$ and $\mu$ at $E_2$.
For this we will rely on a commuting diagram, where we write $L=Q_{\calU(n)}X^c\in s\calL(n)$ and $Y=\BSWres L\in ss\calL(n)$:
\[\xymatrix@C=13mm@R=4mm{
(N_p^\textup{h}\pi_*^{\textup{v}}Q_{\calL(n)}Y)^{\otimes2}&%r1c1
(N_p^\textup{h}Q_{\calW(n+1)}\pi_*^{\textup{v}}Y)^{\otimes2}
\ar[l]_-{(N^\textup{h}_*(\gamma))^{\otimes 2}}
\\%r1c2

\ar[u]^-{D_{p-k+1}^\textup{h}}

\ar[u]^-{D_{p-k+1}}
\ar[l]_-{N^\textup{h}_*(\gamma^{\otimes 2})}
\\%r2c2
N_{p+k-1}^\textup{h}(\pi_*^{\textup{v}}((Q_{\calL(n)}Y)^{\otimes2}))

\ar[uu]_-{\psi_{\calW(n+1)}}
\ar[l]_-{N^\textup{h}_*(\gamma)}
%r4c2
}\]
In this diagram, all of the horizontal maps are isomorphisms, and the two vertical composites are chain maps. (by Singer's Theorem 2.23),  the left hand vertical composite is that used to define the horizontal operations $\Sq^{k}_h$ on $E_2$ (\textbf{(right?)}). On the other hand, the right vertical is used to define the operations on the $\calW(n+1)$-cohomology groups with which the $E_2$-page can be identified. The same proof will apply for $\mu$, if we replace the maps $D_j$ in the top square with $D_0^\textup{h}$, and modify the subscripts $p$ as needed.

What remains is to prove that the bottom square commutes. It may be expanded into the \emph{outer square} in the following larger commuting diagram, which we will abbreviate by omitting the normalisation functors, and the subscripts on indecomposables functors:

The bottom left square commutes simply by naturality of $\gamma$, while the bottom right square is an instance of lemma \ref{LemmaOn xi}. What remains is to check that the hexagon commutes. For notational convenience, write $A=\BSW^{p+k}L$, $\textup{br}:(\pi_* A)^{\otimes 2}\to (\pi_* A)^{\wedge 2}$ for the bracket $a\otimes b\mapsto [a,b]$ on homotopy, and similarly write $\textup{br}:A^{\otimes 2}\to A^{\wedge 2}$ for the chain level bracket. Now any element of $Q((\pi_* A)^{\wedge 2})$ is the class of an expression $\textup{br}(\overline{x}\otimes\overline{y})+E$ where $\overline{x},\overline{y}\in\pi_* A$ are represented by $x,y\in N_*A$, and $E\in(\pi_* A)^{\wedge 2}$ is a sum of terms which are $\lambda$-operations applied to 3-fold brackets of elements of $\pi_* A$. The map $Q(i)$ is induced by the Eilenberg-MacLane map shuffle map $\nabla$ [](\textbf{what exactly?}), and
\[\textup{br}(\overline{x}\otimes\overline{y})\overset{\gamma\circ Q(i)}{\mapsto}\overline{\textup{br}(\nabla(x\otimes y))}\overset{\pi_*(j)}{\mapsto}\overline{(\nabla(x\otimes y))}\overset{D_0}{\mapsto}\overline{x}\otimes \overline{y}.\]
The last mapping follows from the fact that $D_0\circ\nabla=\textup{id}$, as $\{D_k\}$ is special.
Similarly, our understanding of the construction of $\lambda$-operations and iterated brackets shows that $E$ is annihilated by $\pi_*(j)\circ\gamma\circ Q(i)$. As $E$ is also annihilated by $j$, and $j(\textup{br}(\overline{x}\otimes\overline{y})) =\overline{x}\otimes\overline{y}$, the hexagon commutes. \textbf{This is poorly written.}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \ref{E2CompFuncKosOperationsID}]
We must identify the operations $\Sq_\textup{v}^i=\psi_{\BSW}^*\circ\vExtCohOp^{i-1}$ with the $\calW(n+1)$-cohomology operations $\Sq_\textup{v}^i$ defined in \S\ref{section: vertical Koszul operations n positive} using the map $\gamma_i$. Recall that the operations of \S\ref{section: vertical Koszul operations n positive} are the maps induced on cohomology by the \textbf{chain map?}
\[\gamma_i:N_{s_{n+1}+1}(Q_{\calW(n+1)} B^{\calW(n+2)}_{\bullet}\pi_*L)^{2t+1}_{s_{n+1}+i-1,\ldots}\to N_{s_{n+1}}(Q_{\calW(n+1)} B^{\calW(n+2)}_{\bullet}\pi_*L)^{t}_{s_{n+1},\ldots},\]
which we can see on $E^2$ via a morphism
\[\chi:B^{\calW(n+1)}_{\bullet}\pi_*L\to \pi_*(G_\bullet L)\]
of resolutions of $\pi_*L$. 
We will define $\chi$ shortly. If we write $V=Q_{\calL(n)}G_\bullet L$ for the double complex yielding the spectral sequence, this map induces a weak equivalence (in $s\calV$)
\[Q_{\calW(n+1)}(\chi):Q_{\calW(n+1)}B^{\calW(n+1)}_{\bullet}\pi_*L\to \pi_*(V).\]
Now, $\gamma_i$ induces a map on $\calW(n+1)$-homology, whose dual we would like to identify with the composite:
\[\psi_{\BSW}^*\circ\vExtCohOp^{i-1}:\left(E^{p,q}_2(V)\overset{\vExtCohOp^{i-1}}{\to} E^{p,q+i-1}_2(S^2V)\overset{\psi_{\BSW}^*}{\to}E^{p+1,q+i-1}_2(V)\right).\]
However, this composite is itself the dual of an operator:
\[\left(E_{p,q}^2(V)\overset{(\vExtCohOp^{i-1})^*}{\from} E_{p,q+i-1}^2(S^2V)\overset{\psi_{\BSW}}{\from}E_{p+1,q+i-1}^2(V)\right),\]
as Singer gives the formula on $E^2$ \textbf{and it's easy} for vertical operations, and we talked about the dual operations $(\vExtCohOp^{i-1})^*$ like this in []. Thus, what we are to prove is equivalent to a commuting diagram
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
N_{p+1}(QB_\bullet\pi_*L)_{q+i-1}\ar[rr]^-{(\gamma_i)_*}
\ar[d]^-{Q\chi}
&%r1c1
&%r1c2
N_p(QB_\bullet\pi_*L)_q\ar[d]^-{Q\chi}

&%r2c2
N_p(\pi_*(V))_q%r2c3
}\]
Given the description of the operations $(\vExtCohOp^{i-1})^*$, it will suffice to show that the composite
\[(QB_{p+1}\pi_*L)_{q+i-1}\overset{Q\chi}{\to}(\pi_*(Q_{\calL(n)}G_{p+1}L))_{q+i-1}\overset{\psi_{\BSW}}{\to}(\pi_*(S^2(Q_{\calL(n)}G_pL)))_{q+i-1}\]
equals the sum of the composites
\[(QB_{p+1}\pi_* L)_{q+i-1}\overset{(\gamma_i)_*}{\to} (QB_{p}\pi_* L)_q\overset{Q\chi}{\to} (\pi_*QG_{p}L)_q\overset{\sigma_{i-1}}{\to} (\pi_*(S^2(Q_{\calL(n)}G_{p}L)))_{q+i-1}\]
[\textbf{residual question:} what's going on with the phrase: ``including the composite $(\Sq^i)^*=(\gamma_i)_*$ when $i$ is top, which admittedly is not dual to anything whatsoever'' \textbf{answer} nothing probably, as you get top lambda from $q:\textup{PRL}\overset{onto}{\to}S^2$], and also the composite which sorts out the products:
\[(QB_{p+1}\pi_* L)_{q+i-1}\overset{\mu^*\textbf{rename}}{\to}((QB_{p}\pi_* L)^{\otimes2})_{q+i-1}\overset{\pi_*(1+T)\circ(Q\chi)^{\otimes2}}{\to}(\pi_*(S^2(Q_{\calL(n)}G_{p}L)))_{q+i-1}\]

\vfil\pagebreak 

So now, let's define the map $\chi$. We'll use Miller's techniques [Miller p. 55] to define $\chi$ explicitly. For brevity, write $\mathbb{B}$ for the object $B_i^{\calW(n+1)}\pi_*L\in s\calW(n+1)$. Write $V_i$ for the subspace $(F_{\calW(n+1)})^{i}\subset \mathbb{B}$ of generators. For each $m\geq0$, write $F_mV_i$ for the subspace of $V_i$ consisting of degeneracies of elements of $V_j$ for $j\leq m$. Then write $F_m\mathbb{B}$ for the subobject of $\mathbb{B}$ which is almost free on the subspaces $F_mV_i$.

Now for each $m$, $V_m$ splits into a direct sum
\[V_m=V'_m\oplus F_{m-1}V_m,\]
where $V'_m\subset N_m^\textup{h}\mathbb{B}$. To make this classical insight explicit, consider the endomorphism
\[\textup{comp}=(1+s_0d_1)(1+s_1d_2)\cdots (1+s_{n-1}d_n):\mathbb{B}_m\to \mathbb{B}_m.\]
Then, in light of the fact that all the simplicial operators but $d_0$ preserve the subspaces $V_i$, $\textup{comp}$ preserves $V_m$, and for $x\in V_m$, $x-\textup{comp}(x)\in F_{m-1}V_m$. Moreover, by the simplicial identities, $\textup{comp}$ has image inside $N_m^\textup{h}\mathbb{B}$, so we may define $V'_m=\textup{comp}(V_m)$.

In order to define $\chi$, we recursively define its restriction to the skeleta $F_mB$. In order to extend a map $\chi_{m-1}:F_{m-1}\mathbb{B}\to \pi_*(G_\bullet L)$ to a map $\chi_m:F_m\mathbb{B}\to \pi_*(G_\bullet L)$, we need only to specify the values of $\chi_m$ on $V'_m$, which is to choose a lift in the diagram
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
V'_m\ar@{-->}[r]^-{\chi_m}
\ar[d]^-{d_0^\textup{h}}
&%r1c1
N^\textup{h}_m\pi_*(G_\bullet L)\ar[d]^-{d_0^\textup{h}}
\\%r1c2
ZN^h_{m-1}\mathbb{B}\ar[r]^-{\chi_{m-1}}
&%r2c1
\pi_*(G_{m-1}L)%r2c2
}\]
However, we'll record a little more information than this. Rather, for each $m$, we'll construct a function $\overline{\chi}_m:V'_m\to N^\textup{h}_m ZN^\textup{v}_*G_\bullet L$.

In order to do this, one may choose a basis of $V'_m$, and then for each basis element $v$, choose a $\calW(n+1)$-expression $e(s^\textup{h}_{\alpha_j}w_j)$ for $v$, with $w_j\in V'_{n_j}$ for $n_j\leq m-1$ and $s_{\alpha_j}$ some degeneracy operator from $n_j$ to $m-1$. Then we'll define
\[\overline{\chi}_m(v):=z_{e^\textup{rep}(s_{\alpha_j}\overline{\chi}_{n_j}(w_j))}\]
 $d_0^\textup{h}(v)=e(w_1,\ldots)$ maps under $\chi_{m-1}$ to $e(\chi_{m-1}w_1,\ldots)$, which can be lifted to $z_{e^\textup{rep}}$

\begin{proof}[Proof of \ref{EInftyCompFuncOperationsID}]
Given the general theory of Singer's external operations, we only need to show that the diagram of chain complexes
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
T_{m}(Q_{\calL(n)}\BSWres L)
\ar[r]^-{\psi_{\BSW}}
\ar[d]^-{\epsilon}
&%r1c1

\ar[r]^-{\psi_{\calW(n)}}
&%r1c1
N_{m-1}(S^2(Q_{\calL(n)} L))
}\]
commutes up to homotopy (recall that $\psi_{\BSW}$ reduces filtration by one). We will construct whe needed chain homotopy $\Phi$ is constructed as follows. Let $\Phi$ be zero except on 
\[N_0^\textup{h}N_*^\textup{v}(Q\BSWres L)=N_*Q_{\calL(n)}\BSW Q_{\calU(n)}B_\bullet^{\calW(n)}X.\]
The generic element of $N_mQ_{\calL(n)}\BSW Q_{\calU(n)}B_\bullet^{\calW(n)}X$ may be written as a sum of terms
\[z_{f^0(g^1_{i_1}(h^2_{i_1i_2}))}\textup{\quad where $f^0(g^1_{i_1}(h^2_{i_1i_2}))\in ZN_m Q_{\calU(n)}B_\bullet^{\calW(n)}X$}\]
and further terms
\[h_{f^0(g^1_{i_1}(h^2_{i_1i_2}))}\textup{\quad where $f^0(g^1_{i_1}(h^2_{i_1i_2}))\in N_{m} Q_{\calU(n)}B_\bullet^{\calW(n)}X$}.\]
In these descriptions, $f$ is an operator in $F_{\calL(n)}$, while $g$, $h$, etc.\ are operators in $F_{\calW(n)}$.
For brevity we will write $K=k_{f^0(g^1_{i_1}(h^2_{i_1i_2}))}$ for either of $z_{f^0(g^1_{i_1}(h^2_{i_1i_2}))}$ and $h_{f^0(g^1_{i_1}(h^2_{i_1i_2}))}$.
We then define a homotopy 
\[\Phi:T_*(Q_{\calL(n)}\BSWres L)\to N_*(S^2(Q_{\calW(n)}B^{\calW(n)}X))\]
by the formula
\[K\mapsto q(f)(g^1_{i_1}(h^2_{i_1i_2})).\]
This definition makes sense (and yields a nontrivial map) because $f^0$ is an operator in $Q_{\calU(n)}F_{\calW(n)}=F_{\calL(n)}$.
The chain map $d\Phi+\Phi d$ is a sum of three terms:
\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\setlength{\parindent}{.25in}
\item[(a)] $d\circ\Phi:N_0^\textup{fil}N_*^\textup{int}(Q\BSWres L)\overset{\Phi}{\to} N_*(S^2(QL))\overset{d}{\to} N_{*-1}(S^2(QL))$ \textbf{sub in for X?}
\item[(b)] $\Phi\circ d^\textup{int}:N_0^\textup{fil}N_{*}^\textup{int}(Q\BSWres L)\overset{d^\textup{int}}{\to} N_0^\textup{fil}N_{*-1}^\textup{int}(Q\BSWres L)\overset{\Phi}{\to} N_{*-1}(S^2(QL))$
\item[(c)] $\Phi\circ d^\textup{fil}:N_1^\textup{fil}N_{*-1}^\textup{int}(Q\BSWres L)\overset{d^\textup{fil}}{\to} N_0^\textup{fil}N_{*-1}^\textup{int}(Q\BSWres L)\overset{\Phi}{\to} N_{*-1}(S^2(QL))$
\end{enumerate}
Let's start by identifying (a) and (b) applied to $K$:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
(d\circ\Phi)(K)&=d( q(f)(g^1_{i_1}(h^2_{i_1i_2})))\\
&=q(f)(g^0_{i_1}(h^1_{i_1i_2}))\\
&=q(f)(u(g^0_{i_1})(h^1_{i_1i_2}))\quad\textup{(as we calculate in $S^2(QL)$)}\\
(\Phi\circ d^\textup{int})(K)&=\begin{cases}
\Phi( k_{f^0(g^0_{i_1})(h^1_{i_1i_2}))}),&\textup{if `$k$' stands for `$h$'};\\
\Phi(0),&\textup{if `$k$' stands for `$z$'};
%\\,&\textup{if }
\end{cases}\\
&=q(f(g_{i_1}))(h^1_{i_1i_2})\quad\textup{(in either case).}
\end{alignat*}
By (the definition of quadratic part? calculation for this case? Decide.), the sum of these two terms equals $q(uf(g_{i_1}))(h^1_{i_1i_2})$, which is exactly the formula for $(\psi_{\calW(n)}\circ\epsilon)(K)$.

It remains to show that $\Phi\circ d^\textup{fil}$ coincides with $\epsilon^{\otimes 2}\circ\psi_{\calW(n)}$. These two maps are only nonzero on the graded part $N_1^\textup{fil}N_{*-1}^\textup{int}(Q\BSWres L)\subseteq Q_{\calL(n)}\BSW^2 L$ of the total complex, and an element therein is a linear combination
\[K':=\sum_j k_{e_j\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} k_{f^0_{ji_0}g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}}\right)}\]
which satisfies the equation $d_1^\textup{h}(K')=0$, i.e.:
%\[d_1^\textup{fil}(K')=\sum_j k_{e_j\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} {f^0_{ji_0}g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}}\right)}=0.\]
%We may rewrite this equation as
\[\sum_j k_{e_j(f_{ji_0})\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} {g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}}\right)}=0\textup{ in }N_{*-1}Q_{\calL(n)}\BSW Q_{\calU(n)}B_\bullet^{\calW(n)}X.\]
Since the symbol $k$ is used in this condition, it is \emph{very} strong, implying that as $j$ varies, the subscripts 
\[e_j(f_{ji_0})\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} {g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}}\right)\in Q_{\calU(n)}(F_{\calW(n)})^*X\]
each repeat an even number of times. %As the subscripts are elements of $Q_{\Lambda}[F_{\calW(n)}]^{*}M$,
These coincidences also occur if we take quadratic parts of the $e_j(f_{ji_0})$, so that there holds the following equation in $N_{*-1}(S^2(QL))$:
%\[\sum_j {q(e^0_j(f^0_{ji_0}))\left(s_{\alpha_{ji}} g^1_{ji_1}h^2_{ji_1i_2}\right)}=0\in N_{*-1}((QX)^{\otimes2}).\]
\begin{gather*}
\sum q(e_j(f_{ji_0}))\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} {g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}}\right)=0,\textup{ or equivalently}\\
\sum q(e_j(u(f_{ji_0})))\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} {g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}}\right)
=
\sum q(u(e_j)(f_{ji_0}))\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} {g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}}\right).
\end{gather*}
The proof is completed upon noting that the left hand side of this equation equals $(\epsilon^{\otimes 2}\circ \psi_{\BSW})(K')$, while the right hand side equals $(\Phi\circ d^\textup{fil})(K')$. Indeed:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
(\epsilon^{\otimes 2}\circ \psi_{\BSW})(K')
&=
\epsilon^{\otimes 2}\left(\sum q(e_j)\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} k_{f^0_{ji_0}g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}}\right)\right)%
\\
&=
\sum q(e_j)\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} f^0_{ji_0}g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}\right)%
\\
&=
\sum q(e_j(u(f_{ji_0})))\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}\right)=\textup{LHS}
\end{alignat*}
\textbf{(clarify $\psi_{\BSW}$?)} where we may simplify $f_{ji_0}$ to $u(f_{ji_0})$ since we take values in $S^2(QL)$. \textbf{(subscripts on $Q$)} Moreover,
\begin{alignat*}{2}
d^\textup{fil}(K')
&=
\sum e_j\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} k_{f^0_{ji_0}g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}}\right)%
\\
&=
\sum u(e_j)\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} k_{f^0_{ji_0}g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}}\right)%
&\qquad&\text{(in $N_{*-1}^\textup{int}(Q\BSW L)$)}\\
\Phi(d^\textup{fil}(K'))&=
\sum u(e_j)\left( q(f_{ji_0})(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}}g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2})\right)%
&\qquad&\text{(relevant $s_{\alpha_{ji_0}}$ are $\textup{id}$)}\\
&=
\sum q(u(e_j)(f_{ji_0}))\left(s_{\alpha_{ji_0}} {g^1_{ji_0i_1}h^2_{ji_0i_1i_2}}\right) =\textup{RHS}.
\end{alignat*}
To explain further the third equality,  the expression $\sum e_j(s_{\cdots }k_{\cdots })$ represents a sum of $\calL(n)$-expressions $e_j$ in various generators $s_{\cdots }k_{\cdots }$ of the almost free object $\BSW L\in s\calL(n)$. As we have passed to the indecomposables $Q_{\calL(n)}\BSW L$, (\textbf{note}\emph{ above (or here) that we can only say this kind of thing as the monad is really homogeneous}), any non-unit expression is sent to zero, and an expression only lies in the normalisation $N_{*-1}Q_{\calL}\BSW L$ if its unital part consists only of classes $z_{\cdots}$ and $h_{\cdots }$, and not of their degeneracies. Thus, any degeneracies $s_{\cdots }$ appearing in the unital part $u(e_j)$ are in fact simply the identity, and can be ignored when we apply $\Phi$.
\end{proof}

\section{Composite functor spectral sequences OLD VERSION}
\todo{Define the spectral sequence $H^*_{\calW(n)}\Longleftarrow H^*_{\calW(n+1)}H_*^{\Lambda(n)}$}{reference Blanc-Stover, but then give the construction of bisimplicial object (using `$W$' comonad)}
The subject of this paper is to identify the derived functors $H^*_{\calW(0)}X:=(\mathbb{L}_*Q_{\calW(0)}X)^*$, for $X\in\calW(0)$. More generally, we'll now present a spectral sequence that may be used to calculate $H^*_{\calW(n)}X$ for $X\in\calW(n)$. This will a composite functor spectral sequence analogous to Miller's spectral sequence in []. The factorization of $Q_{\calW(n)}$ we will use is of course 
\[Q_{\calW(n)}=\left(\calW(n)\overset{Q_{\calU(n)}}{\to}\calL(n)\overset{Q_{\calL(n)}}{\to}\vect{+}{n}\right)\]
There is an added challenge in this context --- indeed, the available factorization of $Q_{\calW(n)}$ is through a non-abelian category. Thus, the standard technology for composite functor spectral sequences does not apply, and we must use Blanc and Stover's methods []. They observe that the left derived functors $\mathbb{L}_*Q_{\calU(n)}X$ are calculated as the homotopy groups of a simplicial object in $\calL(n)$, namely $Q_{\calU(n)}B_\bullet^{\calW(n)}X$. As such, they have the structure of a $\calL(n)\textup{-$\Pi$-algebra}$, i.e.\ they form an object of $\calW(n+1)$.  After verifying that the functor $Q_{\calU(n)}$ satisfies the requisite acyclicity condition (indeed it preserves free objects), one may apply [relevant BS theorem]: there is a spectral sequence, with $E_r\in\vect{+}{n+2}$,
\[(E_2)_{s_{n+2},\ldots,s_1}^t=((H_*^{\calW(n+1)})(\mathbb{L}_*Q_{\calU(n)})X)_{s_{n+2},\ldots,s_1}^t\implies ((H_*^{\calW(n)})X)_{s_{n+2}+s_{n+1},s_n,\ldots,s_1}^t\]
We'll prefer to work with the dual spectral sequence, (which is equivalent, as we have specified that elements of $\calW(n)$ are locally finite), which has $E^r\in\vect{n+2}{+}$:
\[(E^2)^{s_{n+2},\ldots,s_1}_t=((H^*_{\calW(n+1)})(\mathbb{L}_*Q_{\calU(n)})X)^{s_{n+2},\ldots,s_1}_t\implies ((H^*_{\calW(n)})X)^{s_{n+2}+s_{n+1},s_n,\ldots,s_1}_t\]
These are the homology and cohomology spectral sequences for a bisimplicial abelian group (precisely, an object of $ss\vect{+}{n}$), and we will need to work with this object directly.
\subsection{The Blanc-Stover comonad}
Blanc and Stover \cite{Blanc_Stover-Groth_SS.pdf} define a comonad $\BSW$ (they use the character $W$, which is already overused in this article) on $s\calL(n)$ by defining $\BSW Z$ to be the pushout
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
\bigsqcup_{h,n\geq0}S^n_h
\ar[r]\ar[d]^-{\bigsqcup\imath}
&%r1c1
\bigsqcup_{f,n\geq0}S^n_f\ar[d]\\%r1c2
\bigsqcup_{h,n\geq0}CS^n_h
\ar[r]&%r2c1
\BSW X%r2c2
}\]
where the leftmost two colimits are taken over all maps $h:CS^n\to X$ and the top right colimit is take over all maps $f:S^n\to X$.
%where $H^n_X:=\hom_{\calL(n)}(CS^n,X)$ and $S^n_X:=\hom_{\calL(n)}(S^n,X)$
Here, the left vertical is the coproduct of many copies of the standard inclusion $\imath:S^n\to CS^n$, and the top horizontal map sends a summand $S^n_h$ onto the sphere $S^n_{h\imath}$.

It will be useful to reinterpret this construction via the Dold-Kan correspondence. Indeed, $\hom_{s\calL(n)}(S^n,X)=\hom_{s\vect{+}{n}}(S^n,UX)=\hom_{\textup{ch}\vect{+}{n}}(S^n,UX)=$

Blanc and Stover explain that $\BSW $ actually has the structure of a comonad on $s\calL(n)$. As such, for any simplicial Lie algebra $L_\bullet\in s\calL(n)$, there is a bisimplicial object $B_\bullet^\BSW L_\bullet$, the bar construction using the comonad $\BSW $, given by $B_{s_2}^\BSW L_{s_1}=(\BSW^{s_2+1}L_\bullet)_{s_1}$. Flesh out the point here...

Now $\BSW X$ is homotopy equivalent to a coproduct of spheres. Indeed, for each map $f:S^n\to X$ that extends to a map $CS^n\to X$, \emph{choose} an extension $h_0(f):CS^n\to X$ (so that $h_0(f)\imath=f$). Then $\BSW X$ contains the contractible subobject $C_0:=\bigsqcup_f CS^n_{h_0(f)}$. Moreover, $\BSW X/C_0$ is a wedge of spheres:
\[\BSW X/C_0\cong \left(\bigsqcup_{h\textup{ not chosen}}CS^n_h/\partial(CS^n_h)\right) \sqcup\left(\bigsqcup_{f\textup{ not null}}S^n_f\right)\]
Representatives for a \emph{set} of generators of $\pi_*(\BSW X)$ are 
\[\{CS^n_h-CS^n_{h_0(h\imath)}\ |\ \textup{$h$ was not chosen}\}\cup\{S^n_f\ |\ \textup{$f$ not null}\}.\]
However, it is preferable to find a subspace of $\pi_*(\BSW X)$ which freely generates it as an element of $\calW(n+1)$.
%A thought here is that there are maps of vector spaces we can use. Let $VH_X$ be the free vector space on the homologies to $X$, and let $VS_X$ be the free vector space on the spheres.
For this purpose, observe that there's a natural map $i^*:\F_2[H_X]\to \F_2[S_X]$, and a natural map $\alpha:\ker(i^*)\to\pi_*(\BSW X)$. Moreover, there's a natural map $\beta:\F_2[S_X]\to\pi_*(\BSW X)$. Then $\im (\alpha)$ and $\im (\beta)$ are linearly independent subspaces of $\pi_*(\BSW X)$, and $\pi_*(\BSW X)$ is free on $\im (\alpha)\oplus\im (\beta)$. From this description it is clear that the generating subspaces are preserved by maps in the image of $\BSW $. Moreover, the diagonal of the comonad also preserves the subspaces $\im (\alpha)$ and $\im (\beta)$. That $\im (\alpha)$ is preserved is evident from the definitions. For $\im (\beta)$, note that $\im (\beta)\subset\pi_*(\BSW X)$ is spanned by terms $D_h-D_{h'}$ for $h,h':CS\to X$ satisfying $h\imath=h'\imath$. The diagonal applied to $D_h-D_{h'}$ may be written $D_{D_h}-D_{D_{h'}}$, and one notes that $D_h\imath=S_{h\imath}=S_{h'\imath}=D_{h'}\imath$.

Now the utility of the comonad structure lies in resolving an object $L_\bullet\in s\calL(n)$ by the comonadic bar construction, $B^\BSW_\bullet(L_\bullet)$. This discussion shows that, except for $d_0$, all the maps in $B_\bullet^\BSW L_\bullet$ preserve the subspaces of generators of $\pi_*(B_\bullet^\BSW L_\bullet)$, which is to say that this object of $s\calW(n+1)$ is almost free. Moreover, according to [Stover 2.6], the augmentation map $\pi_*(B_\bullet^\BSW L_\bullet)\to \pi_*(L)$ is a weak equivalence in $s\calW(n+1)$. Thus, this Blanc-Stover $\BSW $-construction provides an almost-free replacement of $\pi_*(L)$ in $s\calW(n+1)$.
%
%
%
% Now we may choose the contractible subobjects of each $W^{n+1}X$ in such a way that the degeneracies $W^{n+1}X\to W^{n+2}X$ are homotopic to wedge inclusions of spheres, c.f.\ \cite[2.5]{StoverVanKampen.pdf}. In particular, the degeneracies of $\pi(W^{n+1}X)\in s\calW(n+1)$ preserve the chosen subspaces of generators. Moreover, all the face maps except $d_0$ are in the image of the functor $W$, and thus preserve subspaces of generators.
%
%
%
% which on homotopy yields an almost free simplicial resolution of $\pi_*(L)\in \calW(n+1)$:
%\[\vcenter{
%\def\labelstyle{\scriptstyle}

%
%
%
% So, if by almost free we mean that there are vector spaces of generators which are preserved by everything except $d_0$, we have shown that $\pi(W^{\bullet+1}X)$ is an almost free object in $s\calW(n+1)$.
%Now there is a bisimplicial object $W^{n+1}X$ using the comonad structure, and we may choose the contractible subobjects of each $W^{n+1}X$ in such a way that the degeneracies $W^{n+1}X\to W^{n+2}X$ are homotopic to wedge inclusions of spheres, c.f.\ \cite[2.5]{StoverVanKampen.pdf}. In particular, the degeneracies of $\pi(W^{n+1}X)\in s\calW(1)$ preserve generators.


\subsection{The Blanc-Stover Spectral sequence}
We'll now give the derivation of the spectral sequence for $X\in\calW(n)$. Indeed, writing $B^{\calW(n)}_{\bullet}X\in s\calW(n)$ for the simplicial bar construction on $X$, we use the double complex associated with the bisimplicial object
\[(Q_{\calL(n)}B^\BSW_{\bullet}(Q_{\calU(n)}X^c))\in ss\vect{+}{n},\]
where $X^c$ is shorthand for the cofibrant replacement of $X$ in $s\calW(n)$ given by the bar construction: $B_\bullet^{\calW(n)}X$.

\subsection{A chain-level diagonal on the $\BSW $ construction}
\todo{give the construction of the chain level diagonal}{}
We have seen, for $L\in s\calL(n)$, that $\pi_*(\BSW L)$ is a free object in $\calW(n+1)$. As such, there is a diagonal
\[\phi_{\calW(n+1)}:\pi_*(\BSW L)\to \pi_*(\BSW L)\sqcup \pi_*(\BSW L).\]
In this section, we'll describe how this map is the map on homotopy induced by a morphism $\phi_\textup{ch}:\BSW L\to \BSW L\sqcup \BSW L$ in $s\calL(n)$ (note that homotopy preserves coproducts of coproducts of spheres). 

In order to construct a map $\phi_\textup{ch}$, it is enough to construct a commuting diagram
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm{
S^n\ar[r]^-{\phi_1}
\ar[d]^-{\imath}
&%r1c1
S^n\sqcup S^n\ar[d]^-{\imath\sqcup\imath}
\\%r1c2
CS^n\ar[r]^-{\phi_2}
&%r2c1
CS^n\sqcup CS^n%r2c2
}\]
The maps $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ can then be applied respectively to all of the sphere and cone classes appearing in $\BSW L$.
In fact, this diagram can even be formed in $s\vect{+}{n}$, before application of $F_{\calL(n)}:\vect{+}{n}\to\calL(n)$, and $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are just the levelwise application of the diagonal map on a simplicial vector space. To understand the effect of $\phi_{\textup{ch}}$ on homotopy, it is enough to identify where the generators of $\pi(\BSW L)$ are sent in $\pi(\BSW L)\sqcup\pi(\BSW L)$, which is easy.
\begin{lem}
$\BSW L$ is naturally a (strict) commutative cogroup object, having comultiplication map $\phi_{\textup{ch}}$, counit map $0:\BSW L\to 0$, and inverse map $\textup{id}:\BSW L\to \BSW L$. In particular, $\hom(\BSW L,\DASH)$ takes values in $\ensuremath{\F_2}$-vector spaces.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
There are a few axioms to check, for example, left counitality: that the composite 
\[\xymatrix@R=4mm@1{
\BSW L\ar[r]^-{\phi_{\textup{ch}}}
&%r1c1
\BSW L\sqcup \BSW L\ar[r]^-{\textup{id}\sqcup0}
&%r1c2
\BSW L%r1c3
}\] is the identity. This follows since $(\textup{id}\sqcup0)\phi_1$ is the identity of $S^n$ and $(\textup{id}\sqcup0)\phi_2$ is the identity of $CS^n$. The other axioms follow similarly.
\end{proof}

Using the notation $*$ for the group operation on $\hom_{s\calL(n)}(\BSW L,L')$, we have the following:
\begin{lem}
For maps $f,g:\BSW L\to L'$ we have 
\[Q_{\calL(n)}(f*g)=(Q_{\calL(n)}f+Q_{\calL(n)}g):Q_{\calL(n)}\BSW L\to Q_{\calL(n)}L'.\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
It's enough to check that $Q_{\calL(n)}(\phi_\textup{ch}):Q_{\calL(n)}\BSW L\to Q_{\calL(n)}(\BSW L\sqcup \BSW L)$ equals the diagonal map $Q_{\calL(n)}\BSW L\to Q_{\calL(n)}\BSW L\oplus Q_{\calL(n)}\BSW L$. For this, $Q_{\calL(n)}$ converts all the colimits involved in the construction of $\BSW L$ to colimits in $s\vect{+}{n}$, and $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are both precisely the diagonal map.
\end{proof}

Now let $\overline{\xi}_{\textup{ch}}$ denote the following composite:
%\[W^2X\overset{\phi_{\textup{ch}}}{\to}(W^2X)^{\sqcup2}\overset{\phi_{\textup{ch}}\sqcup \epsilon}{\to}(W^2X)^{\sqcup2}\sqcup(WX) \overset{\epsilon^{\sqcup2}\sqcup\phi_{ch}}{\to}((WX)^{\sqcup2})^{\sqcup2}\overset{\textup{fold}}{\to}(WX)^{\sqcup2}\]
\[\makebox[0mm][r]{$\overline{\xi}_{\textup{ch}}:\ $}\BSW^2L\overset{\phi_{\textup{ch}}}{\to}(\BSW^2L)^{\sqcup2}\overset{a\sqcup b}{\to}(\BSW L)^{\sqcup2}\]
where $a,b:\BSW^2L\to(\BSW L)^{\sqcup2}$ are the composites
\[\xymatrix@R=2mm{
\makebox[0mm][r]{$a:\ $}\BSW^2L\ar[r]^-{\phi_{\textup{ch}}}
&%r1c1
(\BSW^2L)^{\sqcup2}\ar[r]^-{\epsilon^{\sqcup2}}
&%r1c2
(\BSW L)^{\sqcup2}\\
\makebox[0mm][r]{$b:\ $}\BSW^2L\ar[r]^-{\epsilon}
&%r1c1
(\BSW L)\ar[r]^-{\phi_{\textup{ch}}}
&%r1c2
(\BSW L)^{\sqcup2}
}\]
\begin{lem}
The composite 
$\BSW^2L\overset{\overline{\xi}_{\textup{ch}}}{\to}(\BSW L)^{\sqcup2}\to(\BSW L)^{\times2}$ is zero.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
This follows from the easy observation that both composites $(\textup{id}\sqcup0)\overline{\xi}_{\textup{ch}}$ and $(0\sqcup\textup{id})\overline{\xi}_{\textup{ch}}$ equal $\epsilon:\BSW^2L\to \BSW L$.
\end{proof}
In particular, $\overline{\xi}_{\textup{ch}}$ factors through the smash product, defining a natural map $\xi_{\textup{ch}}:\BSW^2L\to (\BSW L)^{\wedge 2}$.

\textbf{For the time being, write $L$ for the object $Q_{\calU(n)}X^c$ in $s\calL(n)$.}
\begin{lem}
$(d_i)^{\wedge 2}\xi_\textup{ch}=\xi_\textup{ch}d_{i+1}$ for $i\geq1$, and $(d_0)^{\wedge 2}\xi_\textup{ch}= (\xi_\textup{ch}d_{0})*(\xi_\textup{ch}d_{1})$.
The map $Q_{\calL(n)}\xi_\textup{ch}$ induces a degree $(-1,0)$ bicomplex map:
\[N_*N_*(Q_{\calL(n)}B^\BSW_{\bullet}L)^t_{s_{n+2},\ldots,s_1}\to
  N_*N_*(Q_{\calL(n)}((B^\BSW_{\bullet}L)^{\wedge 2}))^t_{s_{n+2}-1,s_{n+1},\ldots,s_1}.\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
I used to say `it's just like Goerss'...
\end{proof}
\end{shaded}
As in the earlier discourse, composition with $j_{\calL(n)}$ yields degree $(-1,0)$ bicomplex map:
\[\psi_\textup{ch}:N_*N_*(Q_{\calL(n)}B^\BSW_{\bullet}L)^t_{s_{n+2},\ldots,s_1}\to
N_*N_*(S^2(Q_{\calL(n)}B^\BSW_{\bullet}L))^{t-1}_{s_{n+2}-1,s_{n+1},\ldots,s_1}.

\subsection{Lie algebras in characteristic 2}
Let $\LieOperad$ be the Lie operad in characteristic 2. As explained in [Fresse], the monad $S(\LieOperad)$ on $\vect{}{}$ defined by
\[S(\LieOperad)(V)=\bigoplus_{n\geq1}(\LieOperad(n)\otimes V^{\otimes n})_{\Sigma_n}\]
does not return the free Lie algebra on $V$ in the traditional sense. Rather, an $S(\LieOperad)$-algebra is a vector space $L$ equipped with a bracket $L\otimes L\to L$ satisfying the Jacobi identity and the antisymmetry condition $[x,y]=-[y,x]$. This condition does \emph{not} imply the alternating condition $[x,x]=0$ (which is impossible to encode operadically). We will refer to structures of this type as $S(\scrL)$-algebras, to distinguish them from Lie algebras, which we demand satisfy the alternating condition.

Fresse constructs a monad $\Gamma(\LieOperad)$ defined by
\[\Gamma(\LieOperad)(V)=\bigoplus_{n\geq1}(\LieOperad(n)\otimes V^{\otimes n})^{\Sigma_n},\]
which represents the free restricted [See Curtis or 6A or something] Lie algebra. He further constructs a norm map $\textup{Tr}:S(\LieOperad)\to \Gamma(\LieOperad)$, and defines a monad $\Lambda(\LieOperad)$ by the formula
\[\Lambda(\LieOperad)V=\im (\textup{Tr}:S(\LieOperad)V\to \Gamma(\LieOperad)V).\]
Then $\Lambda(\LieOperad)(V)$ is the free Lie algebra on $V$, subject to the standard axiom, $[x,x]=0$.

We'll be interested in \emph{partially restricted Lie algebras}. That is, Lie algebras $L$ equipped with a decomposition $L=L_0\oplus L_1$ such that $L_1$ is a Lie ideal and a map $\restn{(\DASH)}:L_1\to L_1$ satisfying the axioms one would expect for a restriction map. Namely, for any $a,b\in L_1$ and $c\in L$, $\restn{(a+b)}=\restn{a}+\restn{b}+[a,b]$, and $[\restn{a},c]=[a,[a,c]]$. There is a free functor from $\vect{}{}\times \vect{}{}$ to partially restricted Lie algebras, sending $(V_0,V_1)$ to the algebra generated by restrictable elements $V_1$ and non-restrictable elements $V_0$. This free functor may be described as follows. There is a natural $\Sigma_n$-equivariant decomposition: %The expressions for $S(\LieOperad)(V_0\oplus V_1)$ and $\Gamma(\LieOperad)(V_0\oplus V_1)$ both contain the terms:
\[\LieOperad(n)\otimes (V_0\oplus V_1)^{\otimes n}=\Bigl(\LieOperad(n)\otimes (V_0)^{\otimes n}\Bigr)\oplus\Bigl(\bigoplus(\LieOperad(n)\otimes V_{i_1}\otimes V_{i_2}\otimes\cdots\otimes V_{i_n})\Bigr)\]
where the direct sum is taken over all sequences $(i_1,\ldots,i_n)\in\{0,1\}^n$ other than $(0,\ldots,0)$.
%and this decomposition is of $\Sigma_n$-modules.
The free partially restricted Lie algebra is the subspace of $\Gamma(\LieOperad(V_0\oplus V_1))$ given by
\[\im \Bigl(S(\LieOperad)(V_0)\overset{\textup{Tr}}{\to}\Gamma(\LieOperad)(V_0\oplus V_1)\Bigr)\oplus\bigoplus_{n\geq1}\Bigl(\bigoplus(\LieOperad(n)\otimes V_{i_1}\otimes V_{i_2}\otimes\cdots\otimes V_{i_n})\Bigr)^{\Sigma_n}\]
