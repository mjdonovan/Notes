We know that the 0-stem is $\Z$ on any sphere $S^n$ with $n>1$, by the Hurewicz theorem. We know the homotopy groups of $S^1$, by covering space theory. 

\pagebreak\DrawTheEHPSS{31}
To calculate the differential $E_{p,0}^1\to E^1_{p-1,0}$, we take the element $\iota\in\pi_p(\Omega^{p+1}{S^{2p+1}})$, apply $p$, to obtain $p(\iota)=w_{p}\in \pi_{p-1}(\Omega^pS^p)$, and then apply $h$, to obtain $h(w_p)\in \pi_{p-1}(\Omega^p S^{2p-1})$. The Hopf invariant of the whitehead square $w_p$ is two when $p$ is even and zero when $p$ is odd.

Now we are able to calculate the 1-stem. Truncating to one column calculates the 1-stem on $S^1$, and we see (again) that this is zero, as there is nothing in the $p+q=1$ diagonal. Truncating to two columns, we obtain a copy of $\Z$. Truncating at three columns, we allow an additional differential, which kills $2\Z\subset\Z$. After this, no more differentials will ever be involved, and so the 1-stem is stable.

Note also that the generator of $\pi_1(\Omega^2 S^2)$ maps to $\iota\in\pi_1(\Omega^2 S^3)$ under $h$. Thus it is a Hopf invariant one element on $S^2$, commonly denoted $\eta$. Moreover, $\pi_1(\Omega^3 S^3)$ is generated by $e\eta$.
\pagebreak\DrawTheEHPSS{36}
As we have calculated the 1-stem on $S^3$ and all higher spheres, we can fill in $E^1_{1,1}$ and $E^1_{2,1}$. Then two more differentials are possible between groups that we have written down.

Firstly, $a$ is zero. To see this, we note that $p(e^3\eta)=w_2\circ (e\eta)$, where $w_2\in\pi_3(S^2)$ and $e\eta\in\pi_4(S^3)$. Now we have calculated the 1-stem on $S^2$ to be $\Z$, generated by the Hopf invariant one element, $\eta$. As $w_2$ has Hopf invariant two, $w_2=2\eta$. Thus:
\[p(e^3\eta)=(2\eta)\circ(e\eta):=\eta\circ(2\iota_3)\circ(e\eta)
\overset{_*}{=}
\eta\circ(e\eta)\circ(2\iota_4)=:2(\eta\circ(e\eta)).\]
So $d_1(e^3\eta):=h(p(e^3\eta))=2\,h(\eta\circ(e\eta))$, and as the target is $\Z_2$, this is zero.

Note that there is a subtlety in the above, at the symbol $\overset{_*}{=}$. We can only make this manipulation since $e\eta$ is a suspension. I'll write this up later.
\pagebreak\DrawTheEHPSS{41}
To see that the differential $b$ vanishes, recall that there is an element $\nu$ of Hopf invariant one in $\pi_3(\Omega^4S^4)$, so that $h(\nu)=\iota\in\pi_3(\omega_4 S^7)$. In particular, $p:\pi_3(\omega_4 S^7)\to\pi_2(\omega_3 S^3)$ is zero, so that no nonzero differentials ever leave $E_{3,0}^1$.
\pagebreak\DrawTheEHPSS{56}%\DrawTheEHPSS{52}%\DrawTheEHPSS{46}
With all of the differentials involving the $p+q=2$ diagonal calculated, we can read off the 2-stem. Knowledge of the 2-stem allows us to fill in the row $E^1_{*,2}$, and we write in two groups soon to be of interest. We also write in another group of interest in the 1-stem, and add in all the possible nonzero differentials between groups we can see.
\pagebreak\DrawTheEHPSS{66}
In order to see that these three differentials all vanish, we cheat a little, assuming that we know that the stable 3-stem is $\Z_8$. Given that information, none of these three differentials could be nonzero, as if they were, the cardinality of the stable 3-stem would have to be strictly less than 8.

The extension problems can all be solved easily given that we are aiming at $\Z_8$, so we can calculate the whole 3-stem.
