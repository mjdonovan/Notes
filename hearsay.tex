\HSsection{Preface}{}
This file is intended only as a repository for mathematical facts I picked up in conversation, and found interesting. I keep this file so that I don't forget \emph{everything} that I've ever been told.

Any given entry is likely to be incorrect; nothing found in this document should be relied upon. Anybody unfortunate enough to be reading this, upon finding an error, should let me know. If you are the person who told me something in here, and want your name at the end let me know. I'm not doing this for now, since stuff in here is likely to be incorrectly transcribed, and nobody wants their name on something that's wrong.

\HSsection{$H_*(X)=\pi_*(\textup{Sp}^\infty X)$ when $X$ is connected}{29/6/11}
Let $X$ be a connected space. Let $\textup{Sp}^\infty X$ be the free topological commutative monoid on $X$, where the basepoint of $X$ acts as the identity. This is the quotient of the james construction $J(X)$ by the infinite permutation group $\Sigma_\infty$. Let $\overline\Z X$ be the free topological abelian group on $X$ with basepoint the identity. Then $\textup{Sp}^\infty X\to \overline\Z X$ is a weak equivalence (iff $X$ is connected).

Moreover, there is a homotopy equivalence between the simplicial abelian groups $\textup{Sing}\overline\Z X$ and $\Z\textup{Sing}X$. Thus $\pi_*(\overline\Z X)=\pi_*(\Z\textup{Sing}X)$. Finally, it is a fact that given a simplicial abelian group, its homotopy groups and its homology groups coincide!


\HSsection{$Q$ turns cofiber sequences into fiber sequences}{29/6/11}
This corresponds to the fact that $\overline\pi_*^s=\pi_*Q$ is a reduced homology theory. $\overline\pi_*^s$ should give you a LES for a cofiber sequence, but $\pi_*$ likes fiber sequences! Here, $QX:=\bigcup\Omega^i\Sigma^i X$.

Now suppose that $X\to Y\to Z$ is a cofiber sequence of $n$-connected spaces. Let $F\to Y$ be the homotopy fiber of $Y\to Z$.  We obtain the a Serre long exact sequence from the Serre spectral sequence, which starts (approximately) at $2n$:
\[\xymatrix{
H_{2n}(F)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Y)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Z)\ar[r]^{\tau\ \ }&H_{2n-1}(F)\ar[r]&\cdots
}\]
Now there is an induced map $\epsilon:X\to F$, so we have arrows between the two long exact sequences:
\[\xymatrix{
H_{2n}(X)\ar[r]\ar[d]^\epsilon&H_{2n}(Y)\ar[r]\ar@{=}[d]&H_{2n}(Z)\ar[r]^{\ \ }\ar@{=}[d]&H_{2n-1}(X)\ar[r]\ar[d]^\epsilon&\cdots\\
H_{2n}(F)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Y)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Z)\ar[r]^{\tau\ \ }&H_{2n-1}(F)\ar[r]&\cdots
}\]
The five lemma will show that $\epsilon$ is an isomorphism on $H_{i}$ for $i$ at most (around) $2n$, as long as we can show that the rightmost square commutes...

\HSsection{Perfect fields}{30/8/11}
A field is said to be perfect if all of its extensions are separable. Any
characteristic zero field is perfect (see below). All finite fields are
obviously perfect, as the frobenius is the identity on $\F_p$. An example of an
infinite perfect field of positive characteristic is
$\F_p(x,x^{1/p},x^{1/p^2},x^{1/p^3},\ldots)$.

\begin{fact*}If $k$ has characteristic $p>0$, then it
is perfect \Iff the Frobenius is an isomorphism.\end{fact*}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that the Frobenius fails to be surjective. Then some element of $k$ has
no $p^\text{th}$ root (any $p^\text{th}$ root is unique). Adjoining the root
gives a non-separable extension.

For the converse, suppose that $F/E$ is an inseparable extension, but that
$\Frob_E$ is an isomorphism, for a contradiction. Choose an element $\alpha$ of
$F$ whose minimal polynomial $f$ has a repeated root. Now unless $f'=0$, $f'$
and $f$ share a factor, and $\gcd(f',f)$ is a polynomial with root $\alpha$, of
strictly lower degree than $f$. This is impossible, so that $f'=0$, and we
conclude that $f(x)=g(x^p)$. (This is why any extension is separable in
characteristic zero).

Now, let $\Gamma=E[\alpha^p]$. Then $\alpha\notin\Gamma$, so that $\Frob_\Gamma$
is not surjective. To see that $\alpha\notin\Gamma$: if it were, there would be
a polynomial $h(x)\in E[x]$ such that $h(\alpha^p)=\alpha$. We can assume that
$\deg(h)$ is less than $\deg(g)$, since $g(\alpha^p)=0$, but then as $\alpha$ is
a root of $h(x^p)-x$, we must have $h(x^p)=x$, which is absurd.

Now as $\Frob_E$ is an isomorphism, the image of $\Frob_\Gamma$ is a finite
dimensional $E$-vector space. Moreover, although $\Frob_\Gamma$ is not
$E$-linear, it does preserve $E$-linearly independent sets. Taking a basis for
$\Gamma$, its image under $\Frob_\Gamma$ is linearly independent, so
$\Frob_\Gamma(\Gamma)$ has the same dimension as $\Gamma$. Thus
$\Frob_\Gamma=\Gamma$, contradicting the fact that $\Frob_\Gamma$ is not
surjective.
\end{proof}

\HSsection{Some number theory}{30/8/11}
Suppose you have a local field $F$ of characteristic zero. Then the integral
closure of $\Z\subset F$ is a ring $\calO_F$ called the ring of integers of $F$.
We'll work with local fields such that $\calO_F$ is a complete local ring.
We write $\frakm_F$ for the maximal ideal.

Now suppose that $E$ is an extension of $F$ such that $\calO_E$ is, like, a DVR
or something, so that I can understand how to calculate the ramification degree.
Then we have a commuting diagram:
\[\xymatrix{
E&\calO_E\ar@{_{(}->}[l]&\frakm_E\ar@{_{(}->}[l]&\calO_E/\frakm_E\\
F\ar[u]&\calO_F\ar@{_{(}->}[l]\ar[u]&\frakm_F\ar@{_{(}->}
[l]\ar[u]&\calO_F/\frakm_F\ar[u]
}\]
Now the image of $\frakm_F$ in $\calO_E$ generates an ideal, necessarily
contained in $\frakm_E$. As $\calO_E$ is a DVR, this ideal is $\frakm_E^r$ for
some $r$, which is the ramification degree. $E/F$ is unramified if $r=1$.

\begin{thm*}
Suppose that $k$ is a perfect field of characteristic $p$. Then there exists a
ring $R$, unique up to unique isomorphism \lparen over $k$\rparen, such that:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item $R$ is local and complete with maximal ideal $\frakm$;
\item $\frakm$ is generated by $p$ \lparen the sum $1+\cdots+1$\rparen; and
\item $R/\frakm\cong k$.
\end{itemize}
This is the \textbf{Witt ring} $W(k)$ of $k$.

In fact, $R$ is an initial object in the category of local complete rings with a
map to $k$.
\end{thm*}
\noindent To interpret this, think of the spectrum of a local complete ring as
somehow a small yet complete neighbourhood of a single closed point. Then $\Spec
R$ is a universal deformation of a universal $k$-point. Any other small
neighbourhood of a $k$-point maps into $\Spec R$. That is, $\Spec R$ contains
every possible deformation of a $k$-point.
\begin{fact*}
Suppose that $E/\Q_p$ is a finite extension. Then $[E:\Q_p]$ is the product of
the residue degree and the ramification degree.
\end{fact*}
\begin{cor*}
There is a unique unramified extension $E$ of $\Q_p$ of a given degree.
\end{cor*}
\begin{proof}
If $E/\Q_p$ is unramified of degree $d$, we get a diagram:
\[\xymatrix{
E&\calO_E\ar@{_{(}->}[l]&\frakm_E=p\calO_E\ar@{_{(}->}[l]&\calO_E/\frakm_E\\
\Q_p\ar[u]&\Z_p\ar@{_{(}->}[l]\ar[u]&p\Z_p\ar@{_{(}->}
[l]\ar[u]&\Z/p\Z\ar[u]
}\]
Now $[\calO_E/\frakm_E:\Z/p\Z]=d$ (see fact), and $\calO_E/\frakm_E$ is a
perfect field. Thus its Witt ring $R$ must be $\calO_E$. Thus $E$ is determined
as the field of fractions of the Witt ring of the field of $p^d$ elements.
\end{proof}
\HSsection{On the $\Proj$ construction}{30/8/11}
It is pointed out that an action of $k^*$ on a $k$-algebra $A$ corresponds to a
grading, under some (as yet unknown) circumstances. Given a grading, $k^*$ acts
by $x\cdot s=x^{|s|}s$. Given an action, it splits up into representations, all
of which are of this form.

On taking quotients, given an action $a:G\times X\to X$, the (categorical)
quotient should be the coequaliser:
\[\xymatrix{
G\times X\ar@<.5ex>[r]^{\ \ \ a}\ar@<-.5ex>[r]_{\ \ \ \pi_X}&X\ar[r]&X/G
}\]
The point is, maybe if you're trying to take the quotient of $\A^{n+1}$ by the
action of $k^*=\Spec k[x^{\pm1}]$, you should throw away the origin. However,
maybe if you take this categorical quotient in the category of, say, separated
schemes, that happens automatically, as the nasty point just doesn't belong in
an object of this category.

One should see a way that the $\Proj$ construction is doing all this for us.
Presumably, this has something to do with the fact that the homogeneous ideals
are exactly those which are $k^*$-invariant. Maybe that means that by restricting to these ideals you get generic points of invariant closed subspaces\ldots\ how would I know?
\HSsection{The Weil Conjectures}{1/9/11}
Suppose that $X$ is a variety over $\Z$, and $p$ is a prime. Then it has
finitely many $\F_{p^n}$-points for each $n$, so we can form the generating
function
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty|X(\F_{p^n})|.\]
One might conjecture that this is a rational function. To prove such a conjecture, somebody showed that this function is of the form:
\[\prod_{d}\left(\chi(\Frob,H^d(X))\right)^{(-1)^d}.\]
Here, $\chi(\Frob,H^d(X))$ is the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius
acting on $H^d(X)$, the \'etale cohomology. It's over some field of different
characteristic, or somesuch.
