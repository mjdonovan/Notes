\HSsection{Preface}{}
This file is intended only as a repository for mathematical facts I picked up in conversation, and found interesting. I keep this file so that I don't forget \emph{everything} that I've ever been told.

Any given entry is likely to be incorrect; nothing found in this document should be relied upon. Anybody unfortunate enough to be reading this, upon finding an error, should let me know. If you are the person who told me something in here, and want your name at the end let me know. I'm not doing this for now, since stuff in here is likely to be incorrectly transcribed, and nobody wants their name on something that's wrong.

\HSsection{$H_*(X)=\pi_*(\textup{Sp}^\infty X)$ when $X$ is connected}{29/6/11}
Let $X$ be a connected space. Let $\textup{Sp}^\infty X$ be the free topological commutative monoid on $X$, where the basepoint of $X$ acts as the identity. This is the quotient of the james construction $J(X)$ by the infinite permutation group $\Sigma_\infty$. Let $\overline\Z X$ be the free topological abelian group on $X$ with basepoint the identity. Then $\textup{Sp}^\infty X\to \overline\Z X$ is a weak equivalence (iff $X$ is connected).

Moreover, there is a homotopy equivalence between the simplicial abelian groups $\textup{Sing}\overline\Z X$ and $\Z\textup{Sing}X$. Thus $\pi_*(\overline\Z X)=\pi_*(\Z\textup{Sing}X)$. Finally, it is a fact that given a simplicial abelian group, its homotopy groups and its homology groups coincide!


\HSsection{$Q$ turns cofiber sequences into fiber sequences}{29/6/11}
This corresponds to the fact that $\overline\pi_*^s=\pi_*Q$ is a reduced homology theory. $\overline\pi_*^s$ should give you a LES for a cofiber sequence, but $\pi_*$ likes fiber sequences! Here, $QX:=\bigcup\Omega^i\Sigma^i X$.

Now suppose that $X\to Y\to Z$ is a cofiber sequence of $n$-connected spaces. Let $F\to Y$ be the homotopy fiber of $Y\to Z$.  We obtain the a Serre long exact sequence from the Serre spectral sequence, which starts (approximately) at $2n$:
\[\xymatrix{
H_{2n}(F)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Y)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Z)\ar[r]^{\tau\ \ }&H_{2n-1}(F)\ar[r]&\cdots
}\]
Now there is an induced map $\epsilon:X\to F$, so we have arrows between the two long exact sequences:
\[\xymatrix{
H_{2n}(X)\ar[r]\ar[d]^\epsilon&H_{2n}(Y)\ar[r]\ar@{=}[d]&H_{2n}(Z)\ar[r]^{\ \ }\ar@{=}[d]&H_{2n-1}(X)\ar[r]\ar[d]^\epsilon&\cdots\\
H_{2n}(F)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Y)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Z)\ar[r]^{\tau\ \ }&H_{2n-1}(F)\ar[r]&\cdots
}\]
The five lemma will show that $\epsilon$ is an isomorphism on $H_{i}$ for $i$ at most (around) $2n$, as long as we can show that the rightmost square commutes...
\HSsection{Is a Serre fibration of CW-complexes is a Hurewicz fibration?}{10/8/11}
There's a lot of doubt about this.

\HSsection{Perfect fields}{30/8/11}
A field is said to be perfect if all of its extensions are separable. Any
characteristic 0 field is perfect. If $k$ has characteristic $p>0$, then it is
perfect \Iff the Frobenius is an isomorphism.

Suppose that the Frobenius fails to be surjective. Then some element of $k$ has
no $p^\text{th}$ root (any $p^\text{th}$ root is unique). Adjoining the root
gives a non-separable extension. The converse...

All finite fields are obviously perfect. An example of an infinite perfect
field of positive characteristic is
$\F_p(x,x^{1/p},x^{1/p^2},x^{1/p^3},\ldots)$.
\HSsection{Some number theory}{30/8/11}
Suppose you have a field $F$ of characteristic zero. Then the integral closure
of $\Z\subset F$ is a ring $\calO_F$ called the ring of integers of $F$. The
field is called local if $\calO_F$ is a complete local ring (?). We write
$\frakm_F$ for the maximal ideal.

Now suppose that $E$ is an extension of $F$ such that $\calO_E$ is, like, a DVR
or something (?). Then we have a commuting diagram:
\[\xymatrix{
E&\calO_E\ar@{_{(}->}[l]&\frakm_E\ar@{_{(}->}[l]&\calO_E/\frakm_E\\
F\ar[u]&\calO_F\ar@{_{(}->}[l]\ar[u]&\frakm_F\ar@{_{(}->}
[l]\ar[u]&\calO_F/\frakm_F\ar[u]
}\]
Now the image of $\frakm_F$ in $\calO_E$ generates an ideal, necessarily
contained in $\frakm_E$. As $\calO_E$ is a DVR, this ideal is $\frakm_E^r$ for
some $r$, which is the ramification degree. $E/F$ is unramified if $r=1$.

\begin{thm*}
Suppose that $k$ is a perfect field of characteristic $p$. Then there exists a
ring $R$, unique up to unique isomorphism \lparen over $k$\rparen, such that:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item $R$ is local and complete with maximal ideal $\frakm$;
\item $\frakm$ is generated by $p$ \lparen the sum $1+\cdots+1$\rparen; and
\item $R/\frakm\cong k$.
\end{itemize}
This is the \textbf{Witt ring} $W(k)$ of $k$.

In fact, $R$ is an initial object in the category of local complete rings with a
map to $k$.
\end{thm*}
\noindent To interpret this, think of the spectrum of a local complete ring as
somehow a small yet complete neighbourhood of a single closed point. Then $\Spec
R$ is a universal deformation of a universal $k$-point. Any other small
neighbourhood of a $k$-point maps into $\Spec R$. That is, $\Spec R$ contains
every possible deformation of a $k$-point.
\begin{fact*}
Suppose that $E/\Q_p$ is a finite extension. Then $[E:\Q_p]$ is the product of
the residue degree and the ramification degree.
\end{fact*}
\begin{cor*}
There is a unique unramified extension $E$ of $\Q_p$ of a given degree.
\end{cor*}
\begin{proof}
If $E/\Q_p$ is unramified of degree $d$, we get a diagram:
\[\xymatrix{
E&\calO_E\ar@{_{(}->}[l]&\frakm_E=p\calO_E\ar@{_{(}->}[l]&\calO_E/\frakm_E\\
\Q_p\ar[u]&\Z_p\ar@{_{(}->}[l]\ar[u]&p\Z_p\ar@{_{(}->}
[l]\ar[u]&\Z/p\Z\ar[u]
}\]
Now $[\calO_E/\frakm_E:\Z/p\Z]=d$ (see fact), and $\calO_E/\frakm_E$ is a
perfect field. Thus its Witt ring $R$ must be $\calO_E$. Thus $E$ is determined
as the field of fractions of the Witt ring of the field of $p^d$ elements.
\end{proof}
