\HSsection{Preface}{}
This file is intended only as a repository for mathematical facts I picked up in conversation, and found interesting. Any given entry is likely to be incorrect, nothing found in this document should be relied upon.

\HSsection{$H_*(X)=\pi_*(\textup{Sp}^\infty X)$ when $X$ is connected}{29/6/11}
Let $X$ be a connected space. Let $\textup{Sp}^\infty X$ be the free topological commutative monoid on $X$, where the basepoint of $X$ acts as the identity. This is the quotient of the james construction $J(X)$ by the infinite permutation group $\Sigma_\infty$. Let $\overline\Z X$ be the free topological abelian group on $X$ with basepoint the identity. Then $\textup{Sp}^\infty X\to \overline\Z X$ is a weak equivalence (iff $X$ is connected).

Moreover, there is a homotopy equivalence between the simplicial abelian groups $\textup{Sing}\overline\Z X$ and $\Z\textup{Sing}X$. Thus $\pi_*(\overline\Z X)=\pi_*(\Z\textup{Sing}X)$. Finally, it is a fact that given a simplicial abelian group, its homotopy groups and its homology groups coincide!


\HSsection{$Q$ turns cofiber sequences into fiber sequences}{29/6/11}
This corresponds to the fact that $\overline\pi_*^s=\pi_*Q$ is a reduced homology theory. It should give you a LES for a cofiber sequence, but $\pi_*$ likes fiber sequences!

Here, $QX:=\bigcup\Omega^i\Sigma^i X$. Now suppose that $X\to Y\to Z$ is a cofiber sequence of $n$-connected spaces. Let $F\to Y$ be the homotopy fiber of $Y\to Z$.  We obtain the a Serre long exact sequence from the Serre spectral sequence, which starts (approximately) at $2n$:
\[\xymatrix{
H_{2n}(F)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Y)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Z)\ar[r]^{\tau\ \ }&H_{2n-1}(F)\ar[r]&\cdots
}\]
Now there is an induced map $\epsilon:X\to F$, so we have arrows between the two long exact sequences:
\[\xymatrix{
H_{2n}(X)\ar[r]\ar[d]^\epsilon&H_{2n}(Y)\ar[r]\ar@{=}[d]&H_{2n}(Z)\ar[r]^{\ \ }\ar@{=}[d]&H_{2n-1}(X)\ar[r]\ar[d]^\epsilon&\cdots\\
H_{2n}(F)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Y)\ar[r]&H_{2n}(Z)\ar[r]^{\tau\ \ }&H_{2n-1}(F)\ar[r]&\cdots
}\]
The five lemma will show that $\epsilon$ is an isomorphism on $H_{i}$ for $i$ at most (around) $2n$, as long as we can show that the rightmost square commutes...
