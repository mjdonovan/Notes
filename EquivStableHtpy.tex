\begin{thm*}[Hill, Hopkins, Ravanel]
If $M$ is a stably framed smooth manifold of Kervaire invariant one, then $\dim
M$ is one of: 2, 6, 14, 30, 62 or 126.
\end{thm*}
\subsection*{Pontryagin (1930s)}
Studied smooth maps $S^{n+k}\to S^n$ in terms
of the preimage $f^{-1}(x_0)$, where $x_0$ is a regular value. As $x$ is
regular, $M_0=f^{-1}(x_0)$ is a smooth manifold.

Moreover, given a choice of basis of $T_{x_0}S^n$, we obtain a trivialisation of
the normal bundle of $M$ in $S^{n+k}$. Thus, $M$ is ``stably framed''. Also, if
$x_0$ and $x_1$ are both regular values, then (choosing a path from $x_0$ to
$x_1$, satisfying some decent condition), we get a cobordism $N$ from $M_0$ to
$M_1$. That is, $\partial N=M_0\sqcup M_1$ ``as stably framed manifolds''.
Pontryagin found:
\[\Maps(S^{n+k},S^n)/\text{htpy}\longleftrightarrow\{\text{stably framed
$k$-manifolds + details...}\}/\text{cobordism}.\]
We neglect to mention what the details are at this point. Instead, we stabilise:
the suspension homomorphism is compatible with the regular value construction,
and one obtains:
\[\pi_k^\text{st}S^0\longleftrightarrow\{\text{stably framed
$k$-manifolds}\}/\text{cobordism}.\]
Note that we are only considering compact manifolds in our discussion.
\subsection*{When \texorpdfstring{$k=0$}{k=0}:}
Any $0$-manifold embeds in $\R$, and a framing there means a choice of
orientation at each point. Opposing points cancel, and the lone cobordism
invariant of stably framed $0$-manifolds is the number of points, counted with
sign.

Of course, this corresponds to the fact that $\pi_0^\text{st}S^0=\Z$.
\subsection*{When \texorpdfstring{$k=1$}{k=1}:}
We can think of two framings of $S^1$. First is the obvious, were one views
$S^1$ as the boundary of $D^2\in \R^2$, and choose a nonvanishing section for
the normal bundle which simply points outward at every point. This represents
zero, as it extends to the disk which $S^1$ bounds.

Next there is a framing where one embeds $S^1$ as a figure $8$ in $\R^2$,
perturbs the two segments of the crossing away from each other into the third
dimension. On of the sections always points in directions parallel to the plane,
while the other section always points upward.

Apparently, these two are different, reflecting that $\pi_2^\text{st}=\Z/2$.

{\color{blue}
Since the tangent bundle of a circle is trivial, the normal bundle of
the circle embedded into Euclidean space is too. The framings of a circle
in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ are just given by the fundamental group of $O(n)$.
For the non-trivial framing I prefer to think of a circle embedded in
3-space in the standard manner. The circle is a roller-coaster ride and as
you move once round the circle you turn once clockwise relative to your
direction of travel. You could have turned around $n$ times in either
direction. This shows $\pi_3(S^2)=\mathbb{Z}$. Once you're embedded in
$4$-space, however, you can slide between the roller-coaster ride taking
you twice around and $0$ times around. So $\pi_4(S^3)=\mathbb{Z}_2$.
\color{red} Cool --- I'd like to glue this in appropriately, but would like to know the exact statement of Portryagin's result first. We should discuss this some time, again.
}

\subsection*{When \texorpdfstring{$k=2$}{k=2}:}
Suppose that a manifold is embedded in $\R^n$, and given a framing of the normal bundle. This framing orients the normal bundle, and using the ambient orientation of $\R^n$, this induces an orientation on the tangent bundle. Thus, we only need to consider \emph{oriented} 2-manifolds.

Now suppose that the framing $\overrightarrow{e}$ on $S^2$ represents zero. If
$\overrightarrow{e_1}$ is another framing, then they are related by
$\overrightarrow{e_1}=T\overrightarrow{e}$ for $T:S^2\to\GL_N(\R)$. Now the
second homotopy group of a Lie group is known to be zero, so that $S^2$ with
\emph{any} framing represents zero.

%If that seemed a little complicated, then it is clear that the framings of
%$S^2$, embedded in the standard way in $\R^{n+2}$, correspond to homotopy
%classes of maps $S^2\to O(n)$. That
{\color{blue} I
would have said the following. Embedding $S^2$ in
$\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ in the standard way it is clear that
the framings of $S^2$ are given by $\pi_2(O(n))=0$. So the standard framing
of $S^2\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ is the only one.
\color{red} I'm not sure that this is really a simplification, and have the following thought: it's not obvious right now that framings actually correspond bijectively with $\pi_2(O(n))$ --- we can see though that there's a surjection from $\pi_2(O(n))$ to the set of framings. It there actually always a bijection between $[X,O(n)]$ and the set of framings? (This is all getting a little silly by now.)}



Now we'd like to deal with a surface $\Sigma\subset\R^N$ of higher genus. The
idea is to use surgery. That is, choose a circle $M$ on $\Sigma$. We can cut
along $M$, and glue a disc to either side of the cut to form a new surface
$\Sigma'$ with genus one lower. However, we need the framing induced on $M$ to
extend over the disk, for the following reason. Suppose that the framing on $M$
does extend. Then we can imagine that $\Sigma'$, as a subspace of $\R^N$, is
literally sitting \emph{within} $\Sigma$. Then there is an unframed cobordism
between $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$ given by filling in the space in between the two
manifolds to get a threefold with boundary. As the framing of $M$ extends to its
bounding disk, we can make this unframed cobordism into a framed cobordism.

Thus, when such a circle $M$ exists, we can perform framed surgery, to reduce
the genus by one. If such a circle always exists, then all framed 2-manifolds
will represent zero, so that $\pi_2^\text{st}S^0=0$.

Pontryagin gave the following argument. There is a function
$\phi:H_1(\Sigma;\Z/2)\to\Z/2$, in which $[M]$ maps to the framed cobordism
class of $M$, where here $M$ is a $1$-manifold in whose fundamental class we are
interested. Now if $\Sigma$ has positive genus, $H_1(\Sigma;\Z/2)$ has dimension
exceeding one, so that $\ker\phi$ is nonzero. That is, one can always find a
circle $M$ along which to perform framed surgery!

The flaw in Pontryagin's argument is that $\phi$ is not linear. Instead it is
quadratic. More specifically, $\phi$ is a quadratic refinement of the
intersection pairing:
\[\phi(x+y)-\phi(x)-\phi(y)=I(x,y).\]
The truth of the matter is that the function $\phi$, being quadratic, has an Arf
invariant $\ArfInvariant(\phi)\in\Z/2$, and it is this invariant which gives the
identification with $\pi_2^\text{st}S^0=\Z/2$.
\begin{question}
In which dimensions can every element of $\pi_k^\text{st}S^0$ be represented by
a homotopy sphere? (As in dimension one, but not in dimension 2.)
\end{question}
\begin{answer}
In all dimensions but 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126.
\end{answer}
\subsection*{Kervaire (1960)}He constructed a map
$\phi:H_{2k+1}(M^{4k+2};\Z/2)\to\Z/2$ which was a quadratic refinement of the
intersection pairing, and defined $\Phi(M)=\ArfInvariant(\phi)$. This is the
Kervaire invariant. He also showed that if $M$ is a smooth manifold of dimension
10 or 18, then $\Phi(M)=0$.

On the other hand, he constructed a 10-manifold $M$ with $\Phi(M)=1$, and thus
produced a manifold with no smooth structure. To construct the manifold $M$, let
$X$ be a certain gluing of two copies of the disk bundle of the tangent bundle
of $S^5$. Then let $N=\partial X\simeq S^9$, and define $M=X\cup\cone(N)$. Then
$M$ is a topological 10-manifold with Kervaire invariant one.
\begin{question}
In which dimensions can $\Phi(M)$ be nonzero (when $M$ is smooth and stably
framed)?
\end{question}
\begin{answer}
Only in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126. 
\end{answer}
\subsection*{Browder}
Browder cleared a path to answering these questions by showing:
\begin{itemise}
\item $\Phi(M)=0$ unless $\dim M=2^{j+1}-2$;
\item An $M$ exists with $\Phi(M)\neq0$ \Iff there is some
$\theta_j\in\pi_{2^{j+1}-2}^\text{st}(S^0)$ represented by $h_j^2$ at the $E^2$
term of the Adams spectral sequence.
\end{itemise}
It is in these terms that we will study this question in this course.
\NewLecture{}{2}{9}
The HHR result states that an $\theta_j$ does not exist when $j\geq7$. There are
four main parts of the proof.
\begin{itemise}
\item[(1)] Construct a multiplicative cohomology theory $\Omega$.
\item[(2)] Prove the \textbf{detection theorem}: If $\theta_j$ exists, it is
detected as a nonzero image in $\Omega_{2^{j+1}-2}(S^0)$.

\INDENT To explain this, we note that there is a distinguished element
$1\in\Omega_0(S^0)$. In particular, given $\theta_j:S^{2^{j+1}-2}\to S^0$ (a map
of spectra), we are interested in $\theta_j^*(1)\in\Omega_{2^{j+1}-2}(S^0)$:
\[\qquad\xymatrix{
\makebox[0cm][r]{$\Omega_{2^{j+1}-2}(S^0)=$\ }\Omega^0(S^{2^{j+1}-2})&
\ar[l]_{\theta_j^*}\Omega^0(S^{0})\ni 1
}\]
That is, we plan to understand the Kervaire invariant by understanding a
``degree'' in the cohomology theory $\Omega$.

One might rephrase the above by saying that the composite
\[\Sigma^{2^{j+1}-2}\mathbb{S}\overset{\theta_j}{\to}\mathbb{S}\overset{\eta}
{\to}\Omega,\]
an element of $\pi_{2^{j+1}-2}(\Omega)$, is non-zero (where $\eta$ is the unit
of the multiplicative theory $\Omega$).
\item[(3)] Prove the \textbf{gap theorem}: that $\pi_i(\Omega)=0$ for $-4<i<0$.
\item[(4)] Prove the \textbf{periodicity theorem}: that
$\pi_i(\Omega)=\pi_{i+256}(\Omega)$ for all $i$.
\end{itemise}
These steps together prove the theorem. Suppose that $\theta_j$ exists. Then
$\pi_{2^{j+1}-2}(\Omega)\neq0$, by (2). However, if $j\geq7$, this group is
zero, by (3) and (4).

For an example of a theory like this, we need look no further than $\KO$. In
fact, the gap here is somehow ubiquitous --- by the end of the course, we'll
have a general construction in which we see these phenomena, and $\KO$ will
arise in this general setting.

The proof of the detection theorem that we will give is not so natural. This is
because we do not understand the Kervaire invariant very geometrically. If it
was given by, say, integrating some characteristic classes of the tangent bundle
of a manifold, then we might have a more natural proof. {\small(This is the
least exciting part of the course, and will be left until the end, in case
something needs to be jettisoned.)}

Note that these techniques were not set up to solve the Arf-Kervaire invariant
problem, more to develop better understanding of the homotopy groups of sphere.
Mike descibed what happened: ``It was as if we were trying to invent a highly
wear-resistant material, but discovered that when we wore it into the bathroom,
we became invisible.''

\subsection*{Atiyah ``\texorpdfstring{$\K$}{K}-theory and reality''}
In this paper, Atiyah introduces the $C_2$-equivariant cohomology theory $\KR$
called `real $\K$-theory' (Mike Hopkins would prefer if it were denoted
${\K_\C}$). This is a hybrid of $\K$ and $\KO$. In fact, given a space $X$ with
a $C_2$-action, $C_2$ acts on $\KR^*(X)$, and the fixed points are isomorphic to
$\KO^*(X)$. On the other hand, $\KR^*(X\times C_2)$ is isomorphic to $\K(X)$.

Moreover, Atiyah used complex Bott periodicity to prove real Bott periodicity
--- that $\KO$ is periodic. That is, classical Bott periodicity states:
\[\K^0(X\wedge S^2)\cong \K^0(X).\]
The same proof applies (\textbf{is this what was said?}) to show that:
\[\KR^0(X\wedge S^{\rho_2})=\KR^0(X).\]
Finally, he used this to imply the classical periodicity theorem, $\K^0(X\wedge
S^8)=\K^0(X)$.

In the above, $S^{\rho_2}$ needs some explanation. Given a representation $\rho$
of a finite group $G$ on a finite dimensional real vector space $V$, define
$S^{\rho}$ to be the one point compactification of $V$, with the obvious
$G$-action. Here, $\rho_2$ stands for the regular representation of $C_2$.
Note also that $S^{\rho_2}$ can be viewed as $\C\cup\{\infty\}$, where $\C$ has
a $C_2$-action given by complex conjugation.\footnote{Complex conjugation on
$\C$ is simply reflection across the real line; writing $C_2=\{\imath,x\}$,
multiplication by $x$ on $\R C_2$ is also just a reflection --- consider the
basis $\{\imath+x,\imath-x\}$.}

\subsection*{HHR's analogue}
HHR contruct an analogue of this situation, in which $\KO$ is replaced with
$\Omega$, and $\KR$ (which should be called $\K_\C$) is replaced with $\OmegaO$.
Now by construction, he has
\[\OmegaO^0(X\wedge S^{\rho_8})\cong\OmegaO^0(X),\]
and, inspired by Atiyah's work, this is used to prove that $\Omega^0(X\wedge
S^{256})=\Omega^0(X)$.

We should discuss the use of the character $\Octonions$, which refers to the
octonions. In the $\KR$ story, $C_2$ is relevant as it is the Galois group
$\Gal(\C/\R)$. The point is that in the HHR construction, $C_8$ is acting as a
`Galois group' $\Gal(\Octonions/\R)$.

To justify such a claim, we would need an action of $C_8$ on $\Octonions$, whose
fixed points are $\R$, and for which a Hilbert basis theorem holds. That is,
$\Octonions$ is isomorphic to $\rho_8$ as a $C_8$-representation over $\R$.
Unfortunately, no such action exists, however:
\begin{fact*}
There is an antiautomorphism $\sigma:\Octonions\to \Octonions$, unique up to
inner automorphisms, such that $\sigma^8=\id$, making $\Octonions\cong\rho_8$ as
a $C_8$-representation. Moreover, we get a Galois correspondence.
\[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
\{\id\}&\langle\sigma^4\rangle&\langle\sigma^2\rangle&C_8\\\hline
\Octonions&\Quaternions&\C&\R
\end{array}\]
\end{fact*}
\subsection*{The slice tower}
This is an analogue of the Postnikov tower of spectra, perhaps the main
innovation given by HHR's work. Recall that for a spectrum $E$, there are
fibrations $F^n\to P^nE\to P^{n-1}E$, and compatible maps $E\to P^nE$ such that:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item $\pi_{i}(P^n E)=0$ for $i>n$;
\item the maps $E\to P^nE$ induce isomorphisms on $\pi_{i}$ for $i\leq n$;
\end{itemize}
Then by the long exact sequence in homotopy, $F^n=H(\pi_n(E))\wedge S^n$. This
data is called a Postnikov tower for $E$.
The associated graded spectrum is the product $\prod_nH(\pi_n(E))\wedge S^n$.
%Note that this associated graded spectrum is the most na\"ive spectrum with the
%same coefficients as $E$.

If $E=\K$ is the $\K$-theory spectrum, then one might say that its associated graded spectrum as a particularly na\"ive 2-periodic spectrum --- writing it as $\prod_n {H\Z}\wedge S^{2n}$ makes this periodicity obvious. $\KR$, however, has a period which is not a number, but a representation, and there is a some tower, the slice tower for $\KR$, whose associated graded is the product $\prod_n {H\Z}\wedge S^{n\rho_2}$.

Note that the spectra ${H\Z}\wedge  S^{n\rho_2}$ are not Eilenberg-MacLane spectra in equivariant homotopy, but something different. Constructing the slice tower was `perhaps the main innovation' given by HHR.
