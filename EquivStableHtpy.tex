\begin{thm*}[Hill, Hopkins, Ravanel]
If $M$ is a stably framed smooth manifold of Kervaire invariant one, then $\dim
M$ is one of: 2, 6, 14, 30, 62 or 126.
\end{thm*}
\subsection*{Pontryagin (1930s)}
Studied smooth maps $S^{n+k}\to S^n$ in terms
of the preimage $f^{-1}(x_0)$, where $x_0$ is a regular value. As $x$ is
regular, $M_0=f^{-1}(x_0)$ is a smooth manifold.

Moreover, given a choice of basis of $T_{x_0}S^n$, we obtain a trivialisation of
the normal bundle of $M$ in $S^{n+k}$. Thus, $M$ is ``stably framed''. Also, if
$x_0$ and $x_1$ are both regular values, then (choosing a path from $x_0$ to
$x_1$, satisfying some decent condition), we get a cobordism $N$ from $M_0$ to
$M_1$. That is, $\partial N=M_0\sqcup M_1$ ``as stably framed manifolds''.
Pontryagin found:
\[\Maps(S^{n+k},S^n)/\text{htpy}\longleftrightarrow\{\text{stably framed
$k$-manifolds + details...}\}/\text{cobordism}.\]
We neglect to mention what the details are at this point. Instead, we stabilise:
the suspension homomorphism is compatible with the regular value construction,
and one obtains:
\[\pi_k^\text{st}S^0\longleftrightarrow\{\text{stably framed
$k$-manifolds}\}/\text{cobordism}.\]
\subsection*{When \texorpdfstring{$k=0$}{k=0}:}
Any $0$-manifold embeds in $S^1$, and a framing there means a choice of
orientation at each point. Opposing points cancel, and the lone cobordism
invariant of stably framed $0$-manifolds is the number of points, counted with
sign.

Of course, this corresponds to the fact that $\pi_0^\text{st}S^0=\Z$.
\subsection*{When \texorpdfstring{$k=1$}{k=1}:}
We can think of two framings of $S^1$. First is the obvious, were one views
$S^1$ as the boundary of $D^2\in \R^2$, and choose a nonvanishing section for
the normal bundle which simply points outward at every point. This represents
zero, as it extends to the disk which $S^1$ bounds.

Next there is a framing where one embeds $S^1$ as a figure $8$ in $\R^2$,
perturbs the two segments of the crossing away from each other into the third
dimension. On of the sections always points in directions parallel to the plane,
while the other section always points upward.

Apparently, these two are different, reflecting that $\pi_2^\text{st}=\Z/2$.
\subsection*{When \texorpdfstring{$k=2$}{k=2}:}
Apparently, when a 2-manifold is framed, it is automatically orientable, so the
base manifolds are just the various orientable surfaces.

Now suppose that the framing $\overrightarrow{e}$ on $S^2$ represents zero. If
$\overrightarrow{e_1}$ is another framing, then they are related by
$\overrightarrow{e_1}=t\overrightarrow{e}$ for $T:S^2\to\GL_N(\R)$. Now the
second homotopy group of a Lie group is known to be zero, so that $S^2$ with
\emph{any} framing represents zero.

Now we'd like to deal with a surface $\Sigma\subset\R^N$ of higher genus. The
idea is to use surgery. That is, choose a circle $M$ on $\Sigma$. We can cut
along $M$, and glue a disc to either side of the cut to form a new surface
$\Sigma'$ with genus one lower. However, we need the framing induced on $M$ to
extend over the disk, for the following reason. Suppose that the framing on $M$
does extend. Then we can imagine that $\Sigma'$, as a subspace of $\R^N$, is
literally sitting \emph{within} $\Sigma$. Then there is an unframed cobordism
between $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$ given by filling in the space in between the two
manifolds to get a threefold with boundary. As the framing of $M$ extends to its
bounding disk, we can make this unframed cobordism into a framed cobordism.

Thus, when such a circle $M$ exists, we can perform framed surgery, to reduce
the genus by one. If such a circle always exists, then all framed 2-manifolds
will represent zero, so that $\pi_2^\text{st}S^0=0$.

Pontryagin gave the following argument. There is a function
$\phi:H_1(\Sigma;\Z/2)\to\Z/2$, in which $[M]$ maps to the framed cobordism
class of $M$, where here $M$ is a $1$-manifold in whose fundamental class we are
interested. Now if $\Sigma$ has positive genus, $H_1(\Sigma;\Z/2)$ has dimension
exceeding one, so that $\ker\phi$ is nonzero. That is, one can always find a
circle $M$ along which to perform framed surgery!

The flaw in Pontryagin's argument is that $\phi$ is not linear. Instead it is
quadratic. More specifically, $\phi$ is a quadratic refinement of the
intersection pairing:
\[\phi(x+y)-\phi(x)-\phi(y)=I(x,y).\]
The truth of the matter is that the function $\phi$, being quadratic, has an Arf
invariant $\ArfInvariant(\phi)\in\Z/2$, and it is this invariant which gives the
identification with $\pi_2^\text{st}S^0=\Z/2$.
\begin{question}
In which dimensions can every element of $\pi_k^\text{st}S^0$ be represented by a homotopy sphere? (As in dimension one, but not in dimension 2.)
\end{question}
\begin{answer}
In all dimensions but 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126.
\end{answer}
\subsection*{Kervaire (1960)}He constructed a map $\phi:H_{2k+1}(M^{4k+2};\Z/2)\to\Z/2$ which was a quadratic refinement of the intersection pairing, and defined $\Phi(M)=\ArfInvariant(\phi)$. This is the Kervaire invariant. He also showed that if $M$ is a smooth manifold of dimension 10 or 18, then $\Phi(M)=0$.

On the other hand, he constructed a 10-manifold $M$ with $\Phi(M)=1$, and thus produced a manifold with no smooth structure.
To construct the manifold $M$, let $X$ be a certain gluing of two copies of the disk bundle of the tangent bundle of $S^5$. Then let $N=\partial X\simeq S^9$, and define $M=X\cup\cone(N)$. Then $M$ is a topological 10-manifold with Kervaire invariant one.
\begin{question}
In which dimensions can $\Phi(M)$ be nonzero (when $M$ is smooth and stably framed)?
\end{question}
\begin{answer}
Only in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126. 
\end{answer}
\subsection*{Browder}
Browder cleared a path to answering these questions by showing:
\begin{itemise}
\item $\Phi(M)=0$ unless $\dim M=2^{j+1}-2$;
\item An $M$ exists with $\Phi(M)\neq0$ \Iff there is some $\theta_j\in\pi_{2^{j+1}-2}^\text{st}S^0$ represented by $h_j^2$ at the $E^2$ term of the Adams spectral sequence.
\end{itemise}
It is in these terms what we will study this question in this course.
