\section*{Hartshorne I.1 --- Affine Varieties}
\index{Hartshorne!I.1: Affine Varieties}
\begin{itemise}
\item A nonempty open subset of an irreducible\index{irreducible} space is
irreducible and dense.\index{dense}
\item The closure of an irreducible subspace is irreducible.
\item For $\fraka\subset A$, $I(Z(\fraka))=\sqrt\fraka$, by the
Nullstellensatz.\index{Nullstellensatz} $Z(I(Y))=\overline Y$.
\item Closed sets correspond to radical\index{radical} ideals. A closed set is
irreducible\index{irreducible} \Iff it corresponds to a prime\index{prime}
ideal. (A topological space is irreducible if it is not the union of two proper
closed subsets).
\item Affine varieties\index{variety} correspond to finitely generated
$k$-algebras which are domains.
\item In a noetherian\index{noetherian!space} topological space, closed sets are
uniquely finite unions of irreducible ones.
\item The dimension\index{dimension} of a space is one less than the length of
the longest chain of distinct irreducible closed subsets. This coincides with
the dimension of the coordinate ring.
\item \textbf{Theorem 1.8A:}\indexThm{I.1.8A} For $k$ a field, $B$ a f.g.\
$k$-algebra which is a domain:\\ \Bullet $\dim(B)$ is the \Index{transcendence
degree} of $K(B)/k$. \ \ \Bullet $\text{height}\,\frakp+\dim B/\frakp=\dim B$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 1.11A:}\indexThm{I.1.11A}
(Hauptidealsatz)\index{Hauptidealsatz} Let $A$ be noetherian, and $f\in A$ be
neither zero divisor nor unit. Then if $\scrI$ is the set of prime ideals
containing $f$, any minimal ideal in $\scrI$ in fact has height one.

\INDENT\emph{Interpretation if $A$ is a UFD} --- $Z(f)$ can be written uniquely
as a union of hypersurfaces $Z(f_i)$. Any maximal closed irreducible subset of
$Z(f)$ has codimension one in $\Spec A$ --- the only larger irreducible is all
of $A$.
\item \textbf{Proposition 1.12A:}\indexThm{I.1.12A} A noetherian domain $A$ is a
UFD \Iff every prime ideal of height one is principal.

\INDENT\emph{Interpretation} --- a noetherian domain $A$ is a UFD \Iff every
maximal proper closed irreducible subset of $\Spec A$ is a hypersurface, the
zero set of one element.

\item A variety $Y\in \A^n$ has dimension $n-1$ \Iff it is a
\Index{hypersurface}: $Z(f)$ for some nonconstant irreducible $f$. The same
holds for a projective variety in $\PP^n$ of dimension $n-1$.
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne I.2 --- Projective Varieties}
\index{Hartshorne!I.2: Projective Varieties}
\begin{itemise}
\item To talk about $\PP^n$, introduce graded ring $S=k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$, zero
sets of homogeneous polynomials,\index{homogeneous} and of homogeneous ideals.
\item Constructed homeomorphism $U_i\to \A^n$. Note that if $Y$ is a
(quasi)-projective variety, it is covered by the (quasi)-affine varieties $Y\cap
U_i$.
\item Closed subsets of $\PP^n$ correspond to homogeneous radical ideals of $S$
not equal to $S_+$, the irrelevant\index{irrelevant} maximal ideal.
\item Given a variety $Y\subset A^n$, the closure $\overline Y$ of $Y$ in
$\PP^n$ is called the projective closure.\index{projective closure} Its ideal is
generated by $\beta(I(Y))$, where $\beta:A\to S$ maps $x_i$ to $x_i/x_0$.
\item Have $d$-uple embedding\index{d-uple} $\PP^n\to\PP^N$ sending
$[x_0:\cdots:x_n]$ to all the degree $d$ monomials. The image of the 2-uple
embedding $\PP^2\to\PP^5$ is called the Veronese surface\index{Veronese
surface}. The image of the $3$-uple embedding of $\PP^1$ in $\PP^3$ is the
twisted cubic\index{twisted cubic} curve.
\item Have the \Index{Segre embedding} $\PP^r\times\PP^s\to\PP^{rs+r+s}$. The
\Index{quadric surface} in $\PP^3$, defined by $xy=zw$, is the Segre embedding
$\PP^1\times\PP^1\to\PP^3$.
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne I.3 --- Morphisms}
\index{Hartshorne!I.3: Morphisms}
\begin{itemise}
\item A function $f:Y\to k$ is regular\index{regular function} if it is locally
a quotient of (homogeneous in projective case) polynomials of the same degree
with nonvanishing denominator. A regular function is continuous.
\item A morphism\index{morphism!of varieties} of varieties is a continuous map
$f:X\to Y$ such that if $\phi:V\to k$ is a regular function for open $V\subset
Y$, then $\phi\circ f$ is regular of $f^{-1}(V)$. That is, $f$ must map the
sheaf $\calO_Y$ of \Index{regular functions} on $Y$ into $\calO_X$ (as
subsheaves of the sheaves of discontinuous functions).
\item For $p\in Y$, have the \Index{local ring} $\calO_{p,Y}$, the stalk of
$\calO_Y$ at $p$. The \Index{function field} is the local ring at the generic
point --- here we should define it to be the direct limit of the $\calO_Y(U)$
over all nonempty open subsets $U$ of $Y$. Elements of the function field are
called \Index{rational functions}. Note that by restriction, we have injections
$\calO_Y(Y)\to\calO_{p,Y}\to K(Y)$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 3.2:}\indexThm{I.3.2} For $Y$ affine,
$\calO_Y(Y)=A(Y)$. $\calO_{p,Y}\cong A(Y)_{\frakm_p}$, and $\dim\calO_{p,y}=\dim
Y$. $p\mapsto\frakm_p$ gives a bijection between points of $Y$ and
\Index{maximal ideals} of $A(Y)$. Finally, $K(Y)\cong A(Y)_{(0)}$, so that
$K(Y)$ is a finitely generated \index{field extension}extension of $k$, of
\Index{transcendence degree} $\dim Y$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 3.4:}\indexThm{I.3.4}
For $Y$ projective, $\calO_Y(Y)=k$, $\calO_{p,Y}=S(Y)_{(\frakm_p)}$, and
$K(Y)=S(Y)_{((0))}$. Here we are using \Index{degree zero localization}s.
\item \textbf{Proposition 3.5:}\indexThm{I.3.5}
There is a natural isomorphism, for varieties $X$ and affine varieties $Y$,
$\Hom(X,Y)\overset{\sim}{\to}\Hom(A(Y),\calO(X))$. In fact, if $\calV$ is the
category of varieties over $k$, and $\calD$ is the category of finitely
generated integral domains over $k$, there is a contravariant \Index{adjunction}
$\calO:\calV\longleftrightarrow\calD^\op:\Spec$, which induces an isomorphism of
categories between $\calD^\op$ and the full subcategory of $\calV$ consisting of
affine varieties.
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne I.4 --- Rational Maps}
\index{Hartshorne!I.4: Rational Maps}
\begin{itemise}
\item Morphisms which agree on a nonempty open subset of a variety are equal.
\item A \Index{rational map} $X\to Y$ is an equivalence class of morphisms
defined on a nonempty open subset of $X$. A rational map is \Index{dominant} if
its image is dense (i.e.\ for some (equivalently any) choice of open subset). A
\Index{birational} map is a rational map with an inverse as rational maps. A
variety is simply \Index{rational} if it is birational to a projective space.
\item The complement of a hypersurface $Z(f)\subset \A^n$ is a hypersurface
$Z(x_{n+1}f)\subset \A^{n+1}$ with coordinate ring $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]_f$.
\item A variety has a \Index{base} for its topology consisting of open affine
subsets.
\item \textbf{Theorem 4.4:}\indexThm{I.4.4}
A dominant rational map induces a map of function fields, and the resulting
correspondence is bijective, giving an contravariant equivalence of categories
from ``varieties with DRMs'' to ``finitely generated field extensions of
$k$''.\item \textbf{Corollary 4.5:}\indexThm{I.4.5}
Varieties are birational \Iff they have isomorphic open subsets \Iff they have
isomorphic function fields.
\item The blowup is defined --- to blow up $0\in Y\subset A^n$, use composite
$\phi:X\to\A^n\times\PP^n\to\A^n$, where $X$ is defined by equations
$x_iy_j=x_jy_i$. Take $\widetilde Y=\overline{\phi^{-1}(Y-0)})$.
\item Rational functions and more generally rational maps have a maximum
\Index{domain of definition}.
\item If $p\in X$ and $q\in Y$ are such that $\calO_{p,X}$ and $\calO_{q,Y}$ are
isomorphic $k$-algebras, then there is a birational map $X\to Y$ taking $p$ to
$q$.
\item If $X\subset\PP^n$ is a projective variety with $\dim X<n-1$, then for
some $p\notin X$, projection from $p$ induces a birational morphism from $X$ to
it's image. Repeating this process, we end up with a \Index{hypersurface} in
$A^{\dim X+1}$ birational to $X$.
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne I.5 --- Nonsingular Varieties}
\index{Hartshorne!I.5: Nonsingular Varieties}
\begin{itemise}
\item If $Y\in\A^n$ is an affine variety with ideal generated by
$f_1,\ldots,f_t$, then $Y$ is \Index{nonsingular} at $p\in Y$ if the rank of the
\Index{Jacobian} $\|(\partial f_i/\partial x_i)(p)\|$ is $n-\dim Y$. (It may be
lower).
\item If $A$ is a noetherian local ring, then say $A$ is a \Index{regular local
ring} if $\dim_{A/\frakm}\frakm/\frakm^2=\dim A$. Note that $\geq$ holds always.
\item \textbf{Theorem 5.1:}\indexThm{I.5.1}
$Y\in\A^n$ is nonsingular at $p$ \Iff $\calO_{p,Y}$ is a regular local ring.
Thus the notion of nonsigularity is intrinsic and extends to all varieties.
\item \textbf{Theorem 5.3:}\indexThm{I.5.3}
For any variety $Y$, the set $\Sing Y$ of singular points is a proper closed
subset.
\item To study very local behavior, we take \Index{completion}s. The completion
of a local ring $(A,\frakm)$ is $\hat A:=\varprojlim
A/\frakm^n=\varprojlim\{\cdots\rightarrow A/\frakm^3\rightarrow
A/\frakm^2\rightarrow A/ \frakm\}$. 
\item \textbf{Theorem 5.4A:}\indexThm{I.5.4A} Suppose $A$ is noetherian. $\hat
A$ is local with maximal ideal $\frakm A$, and $A\to\hat A$ is injective. For
finitely generated $A$-modules $M$, $M\otimes_A\hat A$ is the $\frakm$-adic
completion of $M$. $\dim \hat A=\dim A$ and $\hat A$ is regular \Iff $A$ is
regular.
\item $p\in X$ and $q\in Y$ are \Index{analytically isomorphic} if
$\hat\calO_{p,X}\cong\hat\calO_{q,Y}$ as $k$-algebras.
\item \textbf{Theorem 5.5A:}\indexThm{I.5.5A}(\Index{Cohen Structure Theorem}) 
The only complete regular local ring of dimension $n$ containing a field $k$ is
the power series ring in $n$ variables over $k$. In particular, any two
nonsingular points of the same dimension are analytically isomorphic.
\item \textbf{Theorem 5.7A:}\indexThm{I.5.7A}(\Index{elimination theory}) 
Given homogeneous polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_r\in k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ with
indeterminate coefficients $a_{ij}$, we want to know when they have a common
root other than $(0,0,\ldots,0)$. There a polynomials
$g_1,\ldots,g_t\in\Z[a_{ij}]$, homogeneous in the coefficients of each $f_i$
separately, such that there is a common nonzero root for the $f_i$ \Iff there is
a common root for the $g_t$.
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne I.6 --- Nonsingular Curves}
\index{Hartshorne!I.6: Nonsingular Curves}
\begin{itemise}
\item There is a unique nonsingular projective curve in each birational
equivalence class of curves. For each finitely generated field extension $K/k$
of transcendence degree one, there is then a unique nonsingular projective curve
$C_K$ with function field $K$.
\item Moreover, and homomorphism $K_2\to K_1$ over $k$ is represented by a
morphism $C_{K_1}\to C_{K_2}$.
\item Let $K$ be a field and $G$ be a totally ordered abelian group. A
\Index{valuation} on $K$ with values in $G$ is homomorphism $v:K^\times\to G$
such that for all nonzero $x,y$: $v(x+y)\geq\min\{v(x),v(y)\}$. The
\Index{valuation ring} of $v$ is then $\{0\}\cup v^{-1}({\geq0})$, a local ring
whose units are $\ker v$. The valuation ring always has quotient
field $K$. Call $v$ a valuation of $K/k$ if $v(k^\times)=\{0\}$.
\item If $A,B$ are local rings in a field $K$, then $B$ dominates $A$ if
$A\subseteq B$ and $\frakm_B\cap A=\frakm_A$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 6.1A:}\indexThm{I.6.1A}
A local ring $R$ contained in a field $K$ is a valuation ring of $K$ \Iff it is
a maximal local ring w.r.t.\ domination. Every local ring inside $K$ is
dominated by some valuation ring of $K$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 6.2A:}\indexThm{I.6.2A}
Let $A$ be a noetherian local domain of dimension one. TFAE: 
\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\item $A$ is a discrete valuation ring (i.e.\ comes from a valuation with values
in $\Z$);
\item $A$ is integrally closed (i.e.\ normal);
\item $A$ is a regular local ring (implied by 2, even in higher dimensions);
\item The maximal ideal of $A$ is principal.
\end{enumerate}
\item A \Index{Dedekind domain} is an integrally closed noetherian domain of
dimension one. As integral closure\index{Integrally closed} is a local property,
every localization of a Dedekind domain is a DVR.
\item For $K/k$ a finitely generated extension of transcendence degree one, let
$C_K$\index{abstract nonsingular curve} be the set of all discrete valuation
rings of $K/k$.
\item Given a point $y$ on a nonsingular curve $Y$ with function field $K$,
there's an \emph{injective} function $Y\to C_K$ given by $p\mapsto\calO_{p}\in
C_K$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 6.5:}\indexThm{I.6.5}
For any $x\in K$, all but finitely map $R\in C_K$ contain $x$.

\INDENT\emph{Interpretation} --- $x\notin R$ means that $x$ will have a pole at
$R$ (as an element of the `curve' $C_K$). As $K$ is one dimensional, each $x$
has only finitely many poles.
\item \textbf{Corollary 6.6:}\indexThm{I.6.6}
Any DVR of $K/k$ is the local ring of a point on a nonsingular affine curve.
\item Make $C_K$ a topological space using the cofinite topology. If $U\subseteq
C_K$ is open, define $\calO(U):=\cap_{P\in U}R_P$. An element $f\in\calO(U)$
defines a function $U\to k$ by taking $P$ to the image of $f$ in the residue
field of $\calO_P$, which must be $k$ by 6.6.
\item $f\in\calO(U)$ can be recovered from its function $U\to k$, as if $0\neq
f\mapsto 0$, $f\in\frakm_p$ for all $p$, so $f^{-1}\notin R_p$ for all $p$,
contradicting 6.5, as there must be infinitely many $R_p$ by 6.6. By 6.5, any
$f\in K$ is a regular function on some open $U$. Thus the quotient field of
$C_K$ is $K$. 
\item An \Index{abstract nonsingular curve} is an open subset of $C_K$ with the
induced topology and sheaf of regular functions. A morphism of such is a
continuous map such that regular functions pull back to regular functions.
\item \textbf{Proposition 6.7:}\indexThm{I.6.7} Every nonsingular
quasi-projective curve is isomorphic to an abstract nonsingular curve.
\item \textbf{Theorem 6.9:}\indexThm{I.6.9} $C_K$ is isomorphic to a nonsingular
projective curve.
\item \textbf{Corollary 6.10:}\indexThm{I.6.10} Every abstract nonsingular curve
is isomorphic to a quasi-projective curve. Every nonsingular quasi-projective
curve is isomorphic to an open subset of a nonsingular projective curve.
\item \textbf{Corollary 6.11:}\indexThm{I.6.11} Every curve is birationally
equivalent to a nonsingular projective curve.
\item \textbf{Corollary 6.12:}\indexThm{I.6.12} The following categories are
equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\item[(i)] Nonsingular projective curves and \emph{dominant morphisms};
\item[(ii)] Quasi-projective curves and \emph{dominant rational maps};
\item[(iii)] function fields of dimension 1 over $k$ and $k$-homomorphisms.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Proposition 6.8:}\indexThm{I.6.8} Let $X$ be a nonsingular curve,
$p\in X$, let $Y$ be a projective variety, and let $\phi:X-\{p\}\to Y$ be a
morphism. Then there is a unique extension of $\phi$ to a morphism $X\to Y$.
{\small (This fails if $Y$ is not projective, or if $\dim X>1$.)}
\item Using proposition 6.8, one can show that every automorphism of $\PP^1$ is
in $\PGL(1)$.

\section*{Hartshorne I.7 --- Intersections in Projective Space}
\index{Hartshorne!I.7: Intersections in $\PP^n$}
\section*{Hartshorne II.1 --- Sheaves}
\index{Hartshorne!II.1: Sheaves}
\begin{itemise}
\item A \Index{presheaf} on $X$ is a contravariant functor from the category of
open subsets of $X$ to abelian groups. There is some contention (Bjorn) as to
whether to require $\emptyset\mapsto0$. It's a sheaf if:
\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\item[(3)] If $U$ is open with open cover $\{V_i\}$, and $s\in\scrF(U)$ has
$s|_{V_i}=0$ for all $i$, then $s=0$.
\item[(4)] If $s_i\in\scrF(V_i)$ agree on overlaps, then they glue (uniquely).
\end{enumerate}
Any subpresheaf of a sheaf has (3). Any presheaf maps to the sheaf of its
\Index{discontinuous sections}, and the kernel of this map consists of sections
which violate (3).
%\item A presheaf is a \Index{sheaf} if ``being zero can be determined using an
%open cover'' and if ``gluing sections is possible''.
\item A morphism of sheaves is an isomorphism \Iff it is an isomorphism on the
stalks.
\item The presheaf kernel, cokernel and image are exactly as one would hope.
\item Given a presheaf $\scrF$ there is a universal morphism $\scrF\to\scrF^+$
into a sheaf $\scrF^+$ called the \Index{sheafification}. $\scrF$ and $\scrF^+$
have the same stalks. The sections of $\scrF^+(U)$ can be viewed as sections of
$\cup_{p\in U} \scrF_p\downarrow U$ which are locally induced by sections of
$\scrF$. If $\scrF$ is a sub-presheaf of a sheaf $\scrG$, then
its sheafification is the intersection of all subsheaves of $\scrG$ containing
$\scrF$.
\item Given a morphism of sheaves $\scrF\to\scrG$, the kernel is a sheaf. The
image need not be a sheaf, so we define the \Index{sheaf image} to be the
smallest subsheaf of $\scrG$ containing the presheaf image of $\scrF$. We are
thus already equipped to discuss exact sequences of sheaves, by demanding that
kernel equals \emph{sheaf} image.
\item If $\scrF'\subset\scrF$ is an inclusion of sheaves, the \Index{quotient
sheaf} $\scrF/\scrF'$ is defined to be the sheafification of the quotient
presheaf. The quotient presheaf has (3) but not (4), as if
$[f_i]\in\scrF(V_i)/\scrF'(V_i)$ agree on $V_i\cap V_j$, this only means that
they $f_i-f_j\in \scrF'(V_i\cap V_j)$, and this element may not extend to
$\scrF'(V_i\cup V_j)$.

\INDENT Sections of $(\scrF/\scrF')(U)$ are equivalence classes of collections
of sections of the presheaf on coverings of $U$ which agree on overlaps.
\item A sequence of sheaves is exact\index{exact sequence} \Iff it is exact on
the stalks.
\item Constructing new sheaves from old, given $f:X\to Y$:
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item 
\makebox[3cm][l]{\textbf{\Index{direct image}:} }
\makebox[1cm][r]{$f_*:$\ }$\Sheaves_X\to\Sheaves_Y$,
\makebox[3cm][r]{$(f_*\scrF)(V):=$}
$\scrF(f^{-1}(V))$.
\item
\makebox[3cm][l]{\textbf{\Index{inverse image}:} }
\makebox[1cm][r]{$f^{-1}:$\ }$\Sheaves_Y\to\Sheaves_X$,
\makebox[3cm][r]{$(f^{-1}\scrG)(U):=$}
$\varinjlim_{V\supseteq f(U)} \scrG(V)$.\\
If $f$ is the inclusion of a subspace, we call $f^{-1}\scrG$ the 
\Index{restriction} of $\scrG$ to $X$, denoted $\scrG|_{X}$.
Note that there are maps $f^{-1}f_*\scrF\to \scrF$ and $\scrG\to f_*f^{-1}\scrG$
which are easy to write down, and are the counit and unit of an adjunction
$f^{-1}:\Sheaves_Y\longleftrightarrow\Sheaves_X:f_*$.
\end{itemize}
\item Given an inverse system of sheaves on $X$, the inverse limit
presheaf\index{inverse limit sheaf} is in fact a sheaf, and is the inverse limit
in the category of sheaves on $X$.
\item \textbf{\Index{extension by zero}:} Let $i:Z\to X$ be the inclusion of a
closed subset, and $j:U\to X$ be the inclusion of its complement.
\begin{itemize}\squishlist
\item \textbf{{from sheaf on closed subset}:} Suppose $\scrF$ is a sheaf
on $Z$. Then its extension by zero is simply $i_*\scrF$.
\item \textbf{{from sheaf on open subset}:} Suppose $\scrF$ is a sheaf on
$U$. Then its extension by zero is the sheafification $j_!\scrF$ of
$j_!^-\!\scrF\in\Presheaves_X$, where
$j^-_!\!\scrF(V):=
\begin{cases}\scrF(V),&V\subseteq U\\0,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}$ \\
The stalks on $U$ are unchanged, and are zero on $Z$. $j^-_!\!\scrF$ satisfies
(3) and so embeds in its discontinuous sections, which are identified with the
discontinuous sections of $\scrF$. The sheafification consists of sections of
$\scrF$ whose support (as a subset of $U$) has closure in $X$ not intersecting
$Z$. In this sense, there are fewer sections of $j_!\scrF$ than of $\scrF$.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{\Index{sheaf Hom}:} Given $\scrF,\scrG\in\Sheaves_X$, define
$\shfHom(\scrF,\scrG)\in\Sheaves_X$ by $U\mapsto \Hom(\scrF|_U,\scrG|_U)$.
\item The functor $\Gamma(U,\DASH)$ is left exact from $\Sheaves_X\to \AbGp$. It
is exact on short exact sequences where the kernel is \Index{flasque}.
\item The \Index{support} of a section of a sheaf is the set of points at which
it is nonzero in the stalk. This is a \emph{closed} set!
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne II.2 --- Schemes}
\index{Hartshorne!II.2: Schemes}
\begin{itemise}
\item Define $\Spec A$\index{Spec} to be the set of prime ideals of $A$. For
$\fraka\subseteq A$ any ideal, let $V(\fraka)$ be the set of prime ideals which
contain $\fraka$. These sets are the closed subsets of $\Spec A$. Note that
$V(\fraka)\subseteq V(\frakb)$ \Iff $\sqrt\fraka\supseteq\sqrt\frakb$. Note that
$\frakp\in V(f)$ \Iff $f$ vanishes at $\frakp$, that is, $f$ maps to zero in the
\Index{residue field} $A_\frakp/\frakp A_\frakp\cong (A/\frakp)_{(0)}$ at
$\frakp$.

\INDENT Define a sheaf $\calO$ on $\Spec A$ by assigning $\frakp$ the stalk
$A_\frakp$, and requiring that a section be locally a quotient of elements of
$A$. Together, this data is the \Index{spectrum} of $A$.
\item \textbf{Proposition 2.2:}\indexThm{II.2.2} Let $D(f)$ be the complement of
$V(f)$. Then the ring $\calO(D(f))$ is isomorphic to $A_f$. In particular,
$\Gamma(\calO)\cong A$.
\item A \Index{ringed space} is a pair $(X,\calO_X)$ of a space and a sheaf of
rings. A morphism\index{morphism!of ringed spaces} of ringed spaces is a pair
$(f,f^\#)$ of a map $f:X\to Y$ and a map $f^\#:\calO_Y\to f_*\calO_X$. A
\Index{locally ringed space} is a ringed space wherein the stalks are all local
rings. A morphism of locally ringed spaces is a morphism of ringed spaces where
the maps on stalks are local\index{local homomorphism} (i.e.\ the preimage of
the maximal ideal is the maximal ideal).
\item \textbf{Proposition 2.3:}\indexThm{II.2.3} Each spectrum is a locally
ringed space, and there is a natural bijective correspondence between
homomorphisms $A\to B$ and morphisms $\Spec B\to\Spec A$ of locally ringed
spaces.
\item An \Index{affine scheme} is any ringed space isomorphic to the spectrum of
a ring. A \Index{scheme} is a locally ringed space with an open cover of affine
schemes.
\item Suppose $S$ is a graded ring. Let $\Proj S$\index{Proj} be the set of all
homogeneous prime ideals which do not contain all of $S_+$. If $\fraka$ is a
homogeneous ideal of $S$, let $V(\fraka)$ be the set of elements of $\Proj S$
which contain $\fraka$. The $V(\fraka)$ are the closed sets.

\INDENT Define a sheaf $\calO$ on $\Proj S$ by assigning $\frakp$ the stalk
$S_{(\frakp)}$, the degree zero localization, and requiring that a section be
locally a quotient of homogeneous elements of $S$ of the same degree.
\item \textbf{Proposition 2.5:}\indexThm{II.2.5} Let $D_+(f)$ be the complement
of $V(f)$ for any homogeneous $f$. Then the ringed space
$(D_+(f),\calO(D_+(f)))$ is isomorphic to $\Spec A_{(f)}$, so that $\Proj S$ is
a scheme.
\item \textbf{Proposition 2.6:}\indexThm{II.2.6} Let $k$ be an algebraically
closed field. There is a natural fully faithful functor
$\Varieties(k)\to\Schemes(k)$. For any variety $V$, its topological space is
homeomorphic to the subspace of closed points of $t(V)$, and its sheaf of
regular functions is obtained by restricting the structure sheaf of $t(V)$.

\textbf{Proposition 4.10:}\indexThm{II.4.10} The image of $t$ is exactly the set
of quasi-projective integral schemes over $k$. The image of the set of
projective varieties is the set of integral projective schemes. If $V$ is a
projective variety with homogeneous coordinate ring $S$, then $t(V)\cong \Proj
S$.
\item A scheme is reduced\index{reduced scheme} if $\calO_X(U)$ has no nilpotent
elements for every open subset $U$, or equivalently if $\calO_{X,P}$ has no
nilpotent elements for every $P\in X$. Given a scheme $X$, there is a universal
reduced scheme $X_\textup{red}$ mapping to $X$. The map is a homeomorphism on
spaces.
\item The functor $\Spec$ is right adjoint to global sections, 
$\Gamma:\Schemes\longleftrightarrow\Rings^\op:\Spec$, i.e.:
\[\Hom_{\Schemes}(X,\Spec A)\overset{\cong}{\to}
\Hom_{\Rings}(A,\Gamma(\calO_X)).\]
In particular $\Spec\Z$ is terminal in $\Schemes$.
\item To give a map $\Spec K\to X$, it is equivalent to choose a point of $x$
and specify an inclusion $k(x)\to K$, the \Index{residue field}
$\calO_x/\frakm_x$ at $x$.% Thus the $K$-points\index{K-points} of $X$, the
%morphisms $\Spec K\to X$, capture which points can be defined over $K$.
\item For $x\in X$, define the Zariski \Index{tangent space} at $x$ to be the
$k(x)$-vector space $T_x$ dual to $\frakm_x/\frakm_x^2$. Let
$D=k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2$ be the ring of \Index{dual numbers} over $k$. If $X$
is a scheme over $k$, then to give a $k$-morphism $\Spec D\to X$ is to give a
point $x\in X$ \Index{rational} over $k$ (i.e.\ $k(x)=k$), and an element of
$T_x$. In particular, rational points map to rational points under $k$-maps.
\item Every nonempty irreducible closed subset $Z$ of $X$ has a unique
\Index{generic point}, a point $\zeta$ such that $\{\zeta\}^-=Z$.
\item A scheme is called \Index{quasi-compact} if its underlying topological
space is so. Any affine scheme is quasi-compact.
\item A space is \Index{noetherian} \Iff all of its closed subsets are
quasi-compact. The spectrum of a noetherian ring is a noetherian topological
space.
\item $\Proj S$ is empty \Iff $\Rad(S)\supseteq S_+$. Given a map $\phi:S\to T$
of graded rings, we only get a map $f:U\to \Proj S$, where $U$ is the set of
homogeneous prime ideals in $\Proj T$ whose preimage is not all of $S_+$. $f$
only depends of the $\phi_d$ for $d\gg0$, so can be an isomorphism even if
$\phi$ is not.
\item Suppose $\phi:A\to B$ corresponds to $f:Y=\Spec B\to \Spec A=X$. Then:

\Bullet $\phi$ is injective \Iff $f^\#:\calO_X\to f_*\calO_Y$ is injective, in
which case $f$ is dominant.

\Bullet $\phi$ is surjective \Iff $f$ is a homeomorphism onto a closed subset
and $f^\#$ is surjective.

\item A morphism $X\to Y$ of schemes is:\\
\begin{tabular}{p{.2\textwidth}p{.7\textwidth}}
\Entry{locally of finite type}{if $Y$ can be covered by open affine $V_i=\spec
B_i$ such that each $f^{-1}(V_i)$ can be covered by $\spec A_{ij}$ making

\end{tabular}
All four of these properties are local on the base --- the requirements end up
satisfied for \emph{any} open cover $V_i$.
\item An \Index{open immersion} is simply the inclusion of an open subscheme.
\item A \Index{closed immersion} is a morphism $f:Y\to X$ such that $f$ is a
homeomorphism onto a closed subset of $X$, and $f^\#:\calO_X\to f_*\calO_Y$ is
surjective. Note that the surjectivity condition simply says that any function
on $Y$ should lift to a function on $X$ \emph{locally}.

\INDENT A \Index{closed subscheme} of a scheme $X$ is an equivalence class of
closed immersions, where closed immersions $f_i:Y_i\to X$ are equivalent if
there is an isomorphism $Y_1\to Y_2$ making the triangle commute.

\INDENT For $X$ affine, the closed subsets are the $V(\fraka)$. There is a
different closed subscheme structure on $V(\fraka)$ for each $\fraka'$ with
$\sqrt{\fraka}=\sqrt{\fraka'}$. In fact, every closed subscheme arises in this
way.
\item Given a scheme $X$ and closed subset $Y$, there is a `smallest' closed
subscheme structure for $Y$, the \index{closed subscheme!reduced induced}reduced
induced closed subscheme structure. We construct this when $X$ is affine and
glue. If $X=\Spec A$ and $Y=V(\fraka)$, take $\Spec (X/\sqrt\fraka)\to\Spec X$.
{\small (Note that $\sqrt\fraka$ is the largest ideal available, so there are no
redundant functions in the structure. Allowing a function in
$\sqrt\fraka\setminus\fraka$ allows a nilpotent section.)}
