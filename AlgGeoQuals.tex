\item A nonempty open subset of an irreducible\index{irreducible} space is
irreducible and dense.\index{dense}
\item The closure of an irreducible subspace is irreducible.
\item For $\fraka\subset A$, $I(Z(\fraka))=\sqrt\fraka$, by the
Nullstellensatz.\index{Nullstellensatz} $Z(I(Y))=\overline Y$.
\item Closed sets correspond to radical\index{radical} ideals. A closed set is
irreducible\index{irreducible} iff it corresponds to a prime\index{prime}
ideals.
\item Affine varieties\index{variety} correspond to finitely generated
$k$-algebras which are domains.
\item In a noetherian\index{noetherian} topological space, closed sets are
uniquely finite unions of irreducible ones.
\item The dimension\index{dimension} of a space is one less than the length of
the longest chain of distinct irreducible closed subsets. This coincides with
the dimension of the coordinate ring.
\item \textbf{Theorem 1.8A:}\index{I.1.8A} For $k$ a field, $B$ a f.g.\
$k$-algebra which is a domain:\\ \Bullet $\dim(B)$ is the transcendence degree
of $K(B)/k$. \ \ \Bullet $\text{height}\,\frakp+\dim B/\frakp=\dim B$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 1.11A:}\index{I.1.11A}
(Hauptidealsatz)\index{Hauptidealsatz} Let $A$ be noetherian, and $f\in A$ be
neither zero divisor nor unit. Then if $\scrI$ is the set of prime ideals
containing $f$, any minimal ideal in $\scrI$ in fact has height one.

\INDENT\emph{Interpretation if $A$ is a UFD --- $Z(f)$ can be written uniquely
as a union of hypersurfaces $Z(f_i)$. Any maximal closed irreducible subset of
$Z(f)$ has codimension one in $\Spec A$ --- the only larger irreducible is all
of $A$.}
\item \textbf{Proposition 1.12A:}\index{I.1.12A} A noetherian domain $A$ is a
UFD iff every prime ideal of height one is principal.

\INDENT\emph{Interpretation --- a noetherian domain $A$ is a UFD iff every
maximal proper closed irreducible subset of $\Spec A$ is a hypersurface, the
zero set of one element.}
