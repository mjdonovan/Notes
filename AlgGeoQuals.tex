\section*{Hartshorne I.1 --- Affine Varieties}\index{Hartshorne I.1}
\begin{itemise}
\item A nonempty open subset of an irreducible\index{irreducible} space is
irreducible and dense.\index{dense}
\item The closure of an irreducible subspace is irreducible.
\item For $\fraka\subset A$, $I(Z(\fraka))=\sqrt\fraka$, by the
Nullstellensatz.\index{Nullstellensatz} $Z(I(Y))=\overline Y$.
\item Closed sets correspond to radical\index{radical} ideals. A closed set is
irreducible\index{irreducible} iff it corresponds to a prime\index{prime}
ideals.
\item Affine varieties\index{variety} correspond to finitely generated
$k$-algebras which are domains.
\item In a noetherian\index{noetherian} topological space, closed sets are
uniquely finite unions of irreducible ones.
\item The dimension\index{dimension} of a space is one less than the length of
the longest chain of distinct irreducible closed subsets. This coincides with
the dimension of the coordinate ring.
\item \textbf{Theorem 1.8A:}\index{I.1.8A} For $k$ a field, $B$ a f.g.\
$k$-algebra which is a domain:\\ \Bullet $\dim(B)$ is the \Index{transcendence
degree} of $K(B)/k$. \ \ \Bullet $\text{height}\,\frakp+\dim B/\frakp=\dim B$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 1.11A:}\index{I.1.11A}
(Hauptidealsatz)\index{Hauptidealsatz} Let $A$ be noetherian, and $f\in A$ be
neither zero divisor nor unit. Then if $\scrI$ is the set of prime ideals
containing $f$, any minimal ideal in $\scrI$ in fact has height one.

\INDENT\emph{Interpretation if $A$ is a UFD --- $Z(f)$ can be written uniquely
as a union of hypersurfaces $Z(f_i)$. Any maximal closed irreducible subset of
$Z(f)$ has codimension one in $\Spec A$ --- the only larger irreducible is all
of $A$.}
\item \textbf{Proposition 1.12A:}\index{I.1.12A} A noetherian domain $A$ is a
UFD iff every prime ideal of height one is principal.

\INDENT\emph{Interpretation --- a noetherian domain $A$ is a UFD iff every
maximal proper closed irreducible subset of $\Spec A$ is a hypersurface, the
zero set of one element.}

\item A variety $Y\in \A^n$ has dimension $n-1$ iff it is $Z(f)$ for some
nonconstant irreducible $f$.\index{hypersurface}

\section*{Hartshorne I.2 --- Projective Varieties}\index{Hartshorne I.2}
\begin{itemise}
\item To talk about $\PP^n$, introduce graded ring $S=k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$, zero
sets of homogeneous polynomials,\index{homogeneous} and of homogeneous ideals.
\item Constructed homeomorphism $U_i\to \A^n$. Note that if $Y$ is a
(quasi)-projective variety, it is covered by the (quasi)-affine varieties $Y\cap
U_i$.
\item Closed subsets of $\PP^n$ correspond to homogeneous radical ideals of $S$
not equal to $S_+$, the irrelevant\index{irrelevant} maximal ideal.
\item Given a variety $Y\subset A^n$, the closure $\overline Y$ of $Y$ in
$\PP^n$ is called the projective closure.\index{projective closure} Its ideal is
generated by $\beta(I(Y))$, where $\beta:A\to S$ maps $x_i$ to $x_i/x_0$.
\item Have $d$-uple embedding\index{d-uple} $\PP^n\to\PP^N$ sending
$[x_0:\cdots:x_n]$ to all the degree $d$ monomails. The image of the 2-uple
embedding $\PP^2\to\PP^5$ is called the Veronese surface\index{Veronese
surface}. The image of the $3$-uple embedding of $\PP^1$ in $\PP^3$ is the
twisted cubic\index{twisted cubic} curve.
\item Have the \Index{Segre embedding} $\PP^r\times\PP^s\to\PP^{rs+r+s}$. The
\Index{quadric surface} in $\PP^3$, defined by $xy=zw$, is the Segre embedding
$\PP^1\times\PP^1\to\PP^3$.
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne I.3 --- Morphisms}\index{Hartshorne I.3}
\begin{itemise}
\item A function $f:Y\to k$ is regular\index{regular function} if it is locally
a quotient of (homogeneous in projective case) polynomials of the same degree
with nonvanishing denominator. A regular function is continuous.
\item A \Index{morphism} of varieties is a continuous map $f:X\to Y$ such that
if $\phi:V\to k$ is a regular function for open $V\subset Y$, then $\phi\circ f$
is regular of $f^{-1}(V)$. That is, $f$ must map the sheaf $\calO_Y$ of
\Index{regular functions} on $Y$ into $\calO_X$ (as subsheaves of the sheaves of
discontinuous functions).
\item For $p\in Y$, have the \Index{local ring} $\calO_{p,Y}$, the stalk of
$\calO_Y$ at $p$. The \Index{function field} is the local ring at the generic
point --- here we should define it to be the direct limit of the $\calO_Y(U)$
over all nonempty open subsets $U$ of $Y$. Elements of the function field are
called \Index{rational functions}. Note that by restriction, we have injections
$\calO_Y(Y)\to\calO_{p,Y}\to K(Y)$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 3.2:}\index{I.3.2} For $Y$ affine,
$\calO_Y(Y)=A(Y)$. $\calO_{p,Y}\cong A(Y)_{\frakm_p}$, and $\dim\calO_{p,y}=\dim
Y$. $p\mapsto\frakm_p$ gives a bijection between points of $Y$ and
\Index{maximal ideals} of $A(Y)$. Finally, $K(Y)\cong A(Y)_{(0)}$, so that
$K(Y)$ is a finitely generated \index{field extension}extension of $k$, of
\Index{transcendence degree} $\dim Y$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 3.4:}\index{I.3.4}
For $Y$ projective, $\calO_Y(Y)=k$, $\calO_{p,Y}=S(Y)_{(\frakm_p)}$, and $K(Y)=S(Y)_{((0))}$. Here we are using \Index{degree zero localization}s.
\item \textbf{Proposition 3.5:}\index{I.3.5}
There is a natural isomorphism, for varieties $X$ and affine varieties $Y$,  $\Hom(X,Y)\overset{\sim}{\to}\Hom(A(Y),\calO(X))$. In fact, if $\calV$ is the category of varieties over $k$, and $\calD$ is the category of finitely generated integral domains over $k$, there is a contravariant \Index{adjunction} $\calO:\calV\leftrightarrow\calD^\op:\Spec$, which induces an isomorphism of categories between $\calD^\op$ and the full subcategory of $\calV$ consisting of affine varieties.

\section*{Hartshorne I.4 --- Rational Maps}\index{Hartshorne I.4}
\begin{itemise}
\item Morphisms which agree on a nonempty open subset of a variety are equal.
\item A \Index{rational map} $X\to Y$ is an equivalence class of morphisms defined on a nonempty open subset of $X$. A rational map is \Index{dominant} if its image is dense (i.e.\ for some (equivalently any) choice of open subset).
