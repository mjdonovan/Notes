\section*{Hartshorne I.1 --- Affine Varieties}
\index{Hartshorne!I.1: Affine Varieties}
\begin{itemise}
\item A nonempty open subset of an irreducible\index{irreducible} space is
irreducible and dense.\index{dense}
\item The closure of an irreducible subspace is irreducible.
\item For $\fraka\subset A$, $I(Z(\fraka))=\sqrt\fraka$, by the
Nullstellensatz.\index{Nullstellensatz} $Z(I(Y))=\overline Y$.
\item Closed sets correspond to radical\index{radical} ideals. A closed set is
irreducible\index{irreducible} iff it corresponds to a prime\index{prime}
ideals.
\item Affine varieties\index{variety} correspond to finitely generated
$k$-algebras which are domains.
\item In a noetherian\index{noetherian} topological space, closed sets are
uniquely finite unions of irreducible ones.
\item The dimension\index{dimension} of a space is one less than the length of
the longest chain of distinct irreducible closed subsets. This coincides with
the dimension of the coordinate ring.
\item \textbf{Theorem 1.8A:}\indexThm{I.1.8A} For $k$ a field, $B$ a f.g.\
$k$-algebra which is a domain:\\ \Bullet $\dim(B)$ is the \Index{transcendence
degree} of $K(B)/k$. \ \ \Bullet $\text{height}\,\frakp+\dim B/\frakp=\dim B$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 1.11A:}\indexThm{I.1.11A}
(Hauptidealsatz)\index{Hauptidealsatz} Let $A$ be noetherian, and $f\in A$ be
neither zero divisor nor unit. Then if $\scrI$ is the set of prime ideals
containing $f$, any minimal ideal in $\scrI$ in fact has height one.

\INDENT\emph{Interpretation if $A$ is a UFD} --- $Z(f)$ can be written uniquely
as a union of hypersurfaces $Z(f_i)$. Any maximal closed irreducible subset of
$Z(f)$ has codimension one in $\Spec A$ --- the only larger irreducible is all
of $A$.
\item \textbf{Proposition 1.12A:}\indexThm{I.1.12A} A noetherian domain $A$ is a
UFD iff every prime ideal of height one is principal.

\INDENT\emph{Interpretation} --- a noetherian domain $A$ is a UFD iff every
maximal proper closed irreducible subset of $\Spec A$ is a hypersurface, the
zero set of one element.

\item A variety $Y\in \A^n$ has dimension $n-1$ iff it is a
\Index{hypersurface}: $Z(f)$ for some nonconstant irreducible $f$. The same
holds for a projective variety in $\PP^n$ of dimension $n-1$.
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne I.2 --- Projective Varieties}
\index{Hartshorne!I.2: Projective Varieties}
\begin{itemise}
\item To talk about $\PP^n$, introduce graded ring $S=k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$, zero
sets of homogeneous polynomials,\index{homogeneous} and of homogeneous ideals.
\item Constructed homeomorphism $U_i\to \A^n$. Note that if $Y$ is a
(quasi)-projective variety, it is covered by the (quasi)-affine varieties $Y\cap
U_i$.
\item Closed subsets of $\PP^n$ correspond to homogeneous radical ideals of $S$
not equal to $S_+$, the irrelevant\index{irrelevant} maximal ideal.
\item Given a variety $Y\subset A^n$, the closure $\overline Y$ of $Y$ in
$\PP^n$ is called the projective closure.\index{projective closure} Its ideal is
generated by $\beta(I(Y))$, where $\beta:A\to S$ maps $x_i$ to $x_i/x_0$.
\item Have $d$-uple embedding\index{d-uple} $\PP^n\to\PP^N$ sending
$[x_0:\cdots:x_n]$ to all the degree $d$ monomails. The image of the 2-uple
embedding $\PP^2\to\PP^5$ is called the Veronese surface\index{Veronese
surface}. The image of the $3$-uple embedding of $\PP^1$ in $\PP^3$ is the
twisted cubic\index{twisted cubic} curve.
\item Have the \Index{Segre embedding} $\PP^r\times\PP^s\to\PP^{rs+r+s}$. The
\Index{quadric surface} in $\PP^3$, defined by $xy=zw$, is the Segre embedding
$\PP^1\times\PP^1\to\PP^3$.
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne I.3 --- Morphisms}
\index{Hartshorne!I.3: Morphisms}
\begin{itemise}
\item A function $f:Y\to k$ is regular\index{regular function} if it is locally
a quotient of (homogeneous in projective case) polynomials of the same degree
with nonvanishing denominator. A regular function is continuous.
\item A \Index{morphism} of varieties is a continuous map $f:X\to Y$ such that
if $\phi:V\to k$ is a regular function for open $V\subset Y$, then $\phi\circ f$
is regular of $f^{-1}(V)$. That is, $f$ must map the sheaf $\calO_Y$ of
\Index{regular functions} on $Y$ into $\calO_X$ (as subsheaves of the sheaves of
discontinuous functions).
\item For $p\in Y$, have the \Index{local ring} $\calO_{p,Y}$, the stalk of
$\calO_Y$ at $p$. The \Index{function field} is the local ring at the generic
point --- here we should define it to be the direct limit of the $\calO_Y(U)$
over all nonempty open subsets $U$ of $Y$. Elements of the function field are
called \Index{rational functions}. Note that by restriction, we have injections
$\calO_Y(Y)\to\calO_{p,Y}\to K(Y)$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 3.2:}\indexThm{I.3.2} For $Y$ affine,
$\calO_Y(Y)=A(Y)$. $\calO_{p,Y}\cong A(Y)_{\frakm_p}$, and $\dim\calO_{p,y}=\dim
Y$. $p\mapsto\frakm_p$ gives a bijection between points of $Y$ and
\Index{maximal ideals} of $A(Y)$. Finally, $K(Y)\cong A(Y)_{(0)}$, so that
$K(Y)$ is a finitely generated \index{field extension}extension of $k$, of
\Index{transcendence degree} $\dim Y$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 3.4:}\indexThm{I.3.4}
For $Y$ projective, $\calO_Y(Y)=k$, $\calO_{p,Y}=S(Y)_{(\frakm_p)}$, and
$K(Y)=S(Y)_{((0))}$. Here we are using \Index{degree zero localization}s.
\item \textbf{Proposition 3.5:}\indexThm{I.3.5}
There is a natural isomorphism, for varieties $X$ and affine varieties $Y$,
$\Hom(X,Y)\overset{\sim}{\to}\Hom(A(Y),\calO(X))$. In fact, if $\calV$ is the
category of varieties over $k$, and $\calD$ is the category of finitely
generated integral domains over $k$, there is a contravariant \Index{adjunction}
$\calO:\calV\longleftrightarrow\calD^\op:\Spec$, which induces an isomorphism of
categories between $\calD^\op$ and the full subcategory of $\calV$ consisting of
affine varieties.
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne I.4 --- Rational Maps}
\index{Hartshorne!I.4: Rational Maps}
\begin{itemise}
\item Morphisms which agree on a nonempty open subset of a variety are equal.
\item A \Index{rational map} $X\to Y$ is an equivalence class of morphisms
defined on a nonempty open subset of $X$. A rational map is \Index{dominant} if
its image is dense (i.e.\ for some (equivalently any) choice of open subset). A
\Index{birational} map is a rational map with an inverse as rational maps. A
variety is simply \Index{rational} if it is birational to a projective space.
\item The complement of a hypersurface $Z(f)\subset \A^n$ is a hypersurface
$Z(x_{n+1}f)\subset \A^{n+1}$ with coordinate ring $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]_f$.
\item A variety has a \Index{base} for its topology consisting of open affine
subsets.
\item \textbf{Theorem 4.4:}\indexThm{I.4.4}
A dominant rational map induces a map of function fields, and the resulting
correspondence is bijective, giving an contravariant equivalence of categories
from ``varieties with DRMs'' to ``finitely generated field extensions of
$k$''.\item \textbf{Corollary 4.5:}\indexThm{I.4.5}
Varieties are birational \Iff they have isomorphic open subsets \Iff they have
isomorphic function fields.
\item The blowup is defined --- to blow up $0\in Y\subset A^n$, use composite
$\phi:X\to\A^n\times\PP^n\to\A^n$, where $X$ is defined by equations
$x_iy_j=x_jy_i$. Take $\widetilde Y=\overline{\phi^{-1}(Y-0)})$.
\item Rational fuunctions and more generally rational maps have a maximum
\Index{domain of definition}.
\item If $p\in X$ and $q\in Y$ are such that $\calO_{p,X}$ and $\calO_{q,Y}$ are
isomorphic $k$-algebras, then there is a birational map $X\to Y$ taking $p$ to
$q$.
\item If $X\subset\PP^n$ is a projective variety with $\dim X<n-1$, then for
some $p\notin X$, projection from $p$ induces a birational morphism from $X$ to
it's image. Repeating this process, we end up with a \Index{hypersurface} in
$A^{\dim X+1}$ birational to $X$.
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne I.5 --- Nonsingular Varieties}
\index{Hartshorne!I.5: Nonsingular Varieties}
\begin{itemise}
\item If $Y\in\A^n$ is an affine variety with ideal generated by
$f_1,\ldots,f_t$, then $Y$ is \Index{nonsingular} at $p\in Y$ if the rank of the
\Index{Jacobian} $\|(\partial f_i/\partial x_i)(p)\|$ is $n-\dim Y$. (It may be
lower).
\item If $A$ is a noetherian local ring, then say $A$ is a \Index{regular local
ring} if $\dim_{A/\frakm}\frakm/\frakm^2=\dim A$. Note that $\geq$ holds always.
\item \textbf{Theorem 5.1:}\indexThm{I.5.1}
$Y\in\A^n$ is nonsingular at $p$ \Iff $\calO_{p,Y}$ is a regular local ring.
Thus the notion of nonsigularity is intrinsic and extends to all varieties.
\item \textbf{Theorem 5.3:}\indexThm{I.5.3}
For any variety $Y$, the set $\Sing Y$ of singular points is a proper closed
subset.
\item To study very local behaviour, we take \Index{completion}s. The completion
of a local ring $(A,\frakm)$ is $\hat A:=\varprojlim
A/\frakm^n=\varprojlim\{\cdots\rightarrow A/\frakm^3\rightarrow
A/\frakm^2\rightarrow A/ \frakm\}$. 
\item \textbf{Theorem 5.4A:}\indexThm{I.5.4A} Suppose $A$ is noetherian. $\hat
A$ is local with maximal ideal $\frakm A$, and $A\to\hat A$ is injective. For
finitely generated $A$-modules $M$, $M\otimes_A\hat A$ is the $\frakm$-adic
completion of $M$. $\dim \hat A=\dim A$ and $\hat A$ is regular \Iff $A$ is
regular.
\item $p\in X$ and $q\in Y$ are \Index{analytically isomorphic} if
$\hat\calO_{p,X}\cong\hat\calO_{q,Y}$ as $k$-algebras.
\item \textbf{Theorem 5.5A:}\indexThm{I.5.5A}(\Index{Cohen Structure Theorem}) 
The only complete regular local ring of dimension $n$ containing a field $k$ is
the power series ring in $n$ variables over $k$. In particular, any two
nonsingular points of the same dimension are analytically isomorphic.
\item \textbf{Theorem 5.7A:}\indexThm{I.5.7A}(\Index{elimination theory}) 
Given homogeoneous polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_r\in k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ with
indeterminate coefficients $a_{ij}$, we want to know when they have a common
root other than $(0,0,\ldots,0)$. There a polynomials
$g_1,\ldots,g_t\in\Z[a_{ij}]$, homogeneous in the coefficients of each $f_i$
separately, such that there is a common nonzero root for the $f_i$ \Iff there is
a common root for the $g_t$.
\end{itemise}
\section*{Hartshorne I.6 --- Nonsingular Curves}
\index{Hartshorne!I.6: Nonsingular Curves}
\begin{itemise}
\item There is a unique nonsingular projective curve in each birational
equivalence class of curves. For each finitely generated field extension $K/k$
of transcendence degree one, there is then a unique nonsingular projective curve
$C_K$ with function field $K$.
\item Moreover, and homomorphism $K_2\to K_1$ over $k$ is represented by a
morphism $C_{K_1}\to C_{K_2}$.
\item Let $K$ be a field and $G$ be a totally ordered abelian group. A
\Index{valuation} on $K$ with values in $G$ is homomorphism $v:K^\times\to G$
such that for all nonzero $x,y$: $v(x+y)\geq\min\{v(x),v(y)\}$. The
\Index{valuation ring} of $v$ is then $\{0\}\cup v^{-1}({\geq0})$, a local ring
whose units are $\ker v$. The valuation ring always has quotient
field $K$. Call $v$ a valuation of $K/k$ if $v(k^\times)=\{0\}$.
\item If $A,B$ are local rings in a field $K$, then $B$ dominates $A$ if
$A\subseteq B$ and $\frakm_B\cap A=\frakm_A$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 6.1A:}\indexThm{I.6.1A}
A local ring $R$ contained in a field $K$ is a valuation ring of $K$ \Iff it is
a maximal local ring w.r.t.\ dominanation. Every local ring inside $K$ is
dominated by some valuation ring of $K$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 6.2A:}\indexThm{I.6.2A}
Let $A$ be a noetherian local domain of dimension one. TFAE: 
\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\item $A$ is a discrete valuation ring (i.e.\ comes from a valuation with values
in $\Z$);
\item $A$ is integrally closed (i.e.\ normal);
\item $A$ is a regular local ring (implied by 2, even in higher dimensions);
\item The maximal ideal of $A$ is principal.
\end{enumerate}
\item A \Index{Dedekind domain} is an integrally closed noetherian domain of
dimension one. As integral closure\index{Integrally closed} is a local property,
every localisation of a Dedekind domain is a DVR.
\item For $K/k$ a finitely generated extension of transcendence degree one, let
$C_K$\index{abstract nonsingular curve} be the set of all discrete valuation
rings of $K/k$.
\item Given a point $y$ on a nonsingular curve $Y$ with function field $K$,
there's an \emph{injective} function $Y\to C_K$ given by $p\mapsto\calO_{p}\in
C_K$.
\item \textbf{Theorem 6.5:}\indexThm{I.6.5}
For any $x\in K$, all but finitely map $R\in C_K$ contain $x$.

\INDENT\emph{Interpretation} --- $x\notin R$ means that $x$ will have a pole at
$R$ (as an element of the `curve' $C_K$). As $K$ is one dimensional, each $x$
has only finitely many poles.
\item \textbf{Corollary 6.6:}\indexThm{I.6.6}
Any DVR of $K/k$ is the local ring of a point on a nonsingular affine curve.
\item Make $C_K$ a topological space using the cofinite topology. If $U\subseteq
C_K$ is open, define $\calO(U):=\cap_{P\in U}R_P$. An element $f\in\calO(U)$
defines a function $U\to k$ by taking $P$ to the image of $f$ in the residue
field of $\calO_P$, which must be $k$ by 6.6.
\item $f\in\calO(U)$ can be recovered from its function $U\to k$, as if $0\neq
f\mapsto 0$, $f\in\frakm_p$ for all $p$, so $f^{-1}\notin R_p$ for all $p$,
contradicting 6.5, as there must be infinitely many $R_p$ by 6.6. By 6.5, any
$f\in K$ is a regular function on some open $U$. Thus the quotient field of
$C_K$ is $K$. 
\item An \Index{abstract nonsingular curve} is an open subset of $C_K$ with the
induced topology and sheaf of regular functions. A morphism of such is a
continuous map such that regular functions pull back to regular functions.
\item \textbf{Proposition 6.7:}\indexThm{I.6.7} Every nonsigular
quasi-projective curve is isomorphic to an abstract nonsingular curve.
\item \textbf{Theorem 6.9:}\indexThm{I.6.9} $C_K$ is isomorphic to a nonsingular
projective curve.
\item \textbf{Corollary 6.10:}\indexThm{I.6.10} Every abstract nonsingular curve
is isomorphic to a quasi-projective curve. Every nonsingular quasi-projective
curve is isomorphic to an open subset of a nonsingular projective curve.
\item \textbf{Corollary 6.11:}\indexThm{I.6.11} Every curve is birationally
equivalent to a nonsingular projective curve.
\item \textbf{Corollary 6.12:}\indexThm{I.6.12} The following categories are
equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\item[(i)] Nonsingular projective curves and \emph{dominant morphisms};
\item[(ii)] Quasi-projective curves and \emph{dominant rational maps};
\item[(iii)] function fields of dimension 1 over $k$ and $k$-homomorphisms.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Proposition 6.8:}\indexThm{I.6.8} Let $X$ be a nonsingular curve,
$p\in X$, let $Y$ be a projective variety, and let $\phi:X-\{p\}\to Y$ be a
morphism. Then there is a unique extension of $\phi$ to a morphism $X\to Y$.
{\small (This fails if $Y$ is not projective, or if $\dim X>1$.)}
\item Using proposition 6.8, one can show that every automorphism of $\PP^1$ is
in $\PGL(1)$.

\section*{Hartshorne I.7 --- Intersections in Projective Space}
\index{Hartshorne!I.7: Intersections in Projective Space}
\section*{Hartshorne II.1 --- Sheaves}
\index{Hartshorne!II.1: Sheaves}
\begin{itemise}
\item A \Index{presheaf} on $X$ is a contravariant functor from the category of
open subsets of $X$ to abelian groups. There is some contention (Bjorn) as to
whether to require $\emptyset\mapsto0$. It's a sheaf if:
\begin{enumerate}\squishlist
\item[(3)] If $U$ is open with open cover $\{V_i\}$, and $s\in\scrF(U)$ has $s|_{V_i}=0$ for all $i$, then $s=0$.
\item[(4)] If $s_i\in\scrF(V_i)$ agree on overlaps, then they glue (uniquely).
\end{enumerate}
%\item A presheaf is a \Index{sheaf} if ``being zero can be determined using an
%open cover'' and if ``gluing sections is possible''.
\item A morphism of sheaves is an isomorphism iff it is an isomorphism on the
stalks.
\item The presheaf kernel, cokernel and image are exactly as one would hope.
\item Given a presheaf $\scrF$ there is a universal morphism $\scrF\to\scrF^+$
into a sheaf $\scrF^+$ called the \Index{sheafification}. $\scrF$ and $\scrF^+$
have the same stalks. The sections of $\scrF^+(U)$ can be viewed as sections of
$\cup_{p\in U} \scrF_p\downarrow U$ which are locally induced by sections of
$\scrF$. If $\scrF$ is a sub-presheaf of a sheaf $\scrG$, then
its sheafification is the intersection of all subsheaves of $\scrG$ containing
$\scrF$. Any presheaf with (3) embeds in its sheaf of discontinuous sections,
explaining the initial definition.
\item Given a morphism of sheaves $\scrF\to\scrG$, the kernel is a sheaf. The
image need not be a sheaf, so we define the \Index{sheaf image} to be the
smallest subsheaf of $\scrG$ containing the presheaf image of $\scrF$. We are
thus already equipped to discuss exact sequences of sheaves, by demanding that
kernel equals \emph{sheaf} image.
\item If $\scrF'\subset\scrF$ is an inclusion of sheaves, the \Index{quotient sheaf} $\scrF/\scrF'$ is defined to be the sheafification of the quotient presheaf. The quotient presheaf has (3) but not (4), as if $[f_i]\in\scrF(V_i)/\scrF'(V_i)$ agree on $V_i\cap V_j$, this only means that they $f_i-f_j\in \scrF'(V_i\cap V_j)$, and this element may not extend to $\scrF'(V_i\cup V_j)$.

\INDENT Sections of $(\scrF/\scrF')(U)$ are equivalence classes of collections of sections of the presheaf on coverings of $U$ which agree on overlaps.
\item A sequence of sheaves is \Index{exact} \Iff it is exact on the stalks.
