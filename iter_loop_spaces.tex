\section{Operads and \texorpdfstring{$\scrC$}{C}-spaces}
Let $\scrU$ be the category of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces and continuous
 maps. 
Let $\scrT$ be the same with nondegenerate basepoints.

An \emph{operad} $\scrC$ consists of spaces $\scrC(j)\in\scrU$ for $j\geq0$,
 with $\scrC(0)=*$, and maps
\[\gamma:\scrC(k)\times\scrC(j_1)\times\cdots\times\scrC(j_k)\to\scrC(j)
\text{ whenever }j=\sum j_i,\]
subject to certain restrictions. We should interpret the points of $\scrC(j)$ as
$j$-adic operations, and the restrictions reflect this interpretation.
$\gamma(c;d_1,\ldots,d_k)$ should be viewed as the operation which takes $j$
inputs, applies $d_1,\ldots,d_k$ to them in order, and then hits the list of
results with $c$.
\begin{itemise}
\item An associativity formula holds.
\item There's an identity $1\in\scrC(1)$ such that $\gamma(c;1^k)=c$ for all $c$.
\item There's a right action of $\Sigma_j$ on $\scrC(j)$ which should be viewed as
permutation of the arguments of an operation. There's an equivariance formula on
the function $\gamma$. An operad is $\Sigma$-free is $\Sigma_j$ acts freely for
each $j$.
\end{itemise}
A morphism of operads is the only thing it could be. The \emph{endomorphism
operad} $\xi_X$ of $X\in\scrT$ has $\xi_X(j)$ the space of based maps $X^j\to
X$, with the only operad structure it could have. The axioms for an operad are
modeled on the obvious properties of $\xi_X$.

An operation $\theta$ of an operad $\scrC$ on a space is a morphism
$\theta:\scrC\to\xi_X$, and $(X,\theta)$ is then said to be a $\scrC$-space. These
form a category $\scrC[\scrT]$, whose morphisms consist of maps in $\scrT$ which
commute with the action.
\begin{thm*}[1.3]
There exist $\Sigma$-free operads $\scrC_n$ ($1\leq n\leq\infty$) such that every
$n$-fold loop space is a $\scrC_n$-space, and every connected $\scrC_n$-space
is weakly equivalent to an $n$-fold loop space. (The spaces $\scrC_n(j)$ are 
$(n-2)$-connected).
\end{thm*}
When $n=1$  (resp.\ $n=\infty$), $\scrC_1$ can be any $A_\infty$ 
(resp.\ $E_\infty$) operad, as defined later.

Let $\scrC$ be any operad and $X$ a $\scrC$-space. For any point
$c\in\scrC(1)$, $\theta_2(c):X^2\to X$ is a candidate multiplication.
Now if $\scrC(1)$ is connected, then $*$ is a two-sided homotopy identity, as
we can use any paths from $\gamma(c;1,*)$ to $1$, etc.
If moreover $\Sigma_2$ is connected, using the transposition we have that
$\theta_2(c)$ is homotopy commutative.

Note that Stasheff's $A_\infty$-space theory states that an $H$-space is of
the homotopy type of a loop space iff it has all possible higher coherence
homotopies for associativity.
\begin{lem*}[1.4]
An action $\theta:\scrC\to\xi_X$ determines and is determined by maps 
$\theta_j:\scrC(j)\times X^j\to X$ (adjoint to the maps $\scrC(j)\to\xi_X(j)$)
satisfying some coherences and equivariances, and morphisms of $\scrC$-spaces 
can be easily described in this language.
\end{lem*}
\begin{lem*}[1.5]
If $X\in\scrC[\scrT]$, and $(Y,A)$ is an NDR-pair in $\scrU$, then 
$\Map((Y,A),(X,*))=:X^{(Y,A)}$ is also a $\scrC$-space. (Note that operations
on $X$ give rise to operations on $X^{(Y,A)}$). In particular, $\scrC[\scrT]$ is
closed under taking path and loop spaces.
\end{lem*}
\begin{lem*}[1.6]
The one point space $*$ is a zero object in $\scrC[\scrT]$.
\end{lem*}
\begin{lem*}[1.7]
Given maps $X\to B$ and $Y\to B$ of $\scrC$-spaces, the fiber product is a 
$\scrC$-space, and is the fiber product in the category $\scrC[\scrT]$.
\end{lem*}
\begin{lem*}[1.8] We get a bunch of nice $\scrC$-morphisms from a $\scrC$-morphism
$X\to Y$ by taking a homotopy fiber-type diagram:
\[\xymatrix{
\makebox[2cm][r]{$\widetilde X=X\times_Y(Y^I)$}\ar[r]\ar[d]&Y^I\ar[d]\\
X\ar[r]&Y
}\]
In particular, we get an inclusion $i:X\to \widetilde X$,
retraction $r:\widetilde X\to X$, and fibration 
$\widetilde f:\widetilde X\to Y$.
\end{lem*}
\begin{lem*}[1.9]
Suppose $X\in\scrC[\scrT]$, and $c\in\scrC(2)$ is fixed, giving 
$\oldphi:=\theta(c):X^2\to X$. Let 
$\oldphi_j=\oldphi(1\times \oldphi_{j-1}):X^j\to X$ be the iterated product 
for each $j$.
\begin{itemise}
\item If $\scrC(j)$ is connected and $d\in\scrC(j)$, then $\theta(d)$ is 
homotopic to the iterated product $\oldphi_j$.
\item If $\scrC(j)$ is $\Sigma_j$-free and $\scrC(2j)$ is contractible, then given
$2j$ points of $X$ and a point $d\in\scrC(j)$, it is equivalent to either ``first
multiply the points in pairs using $\oldphi$, then apply $\theta(d)$'', or to apply 
$\theta(d)$ to the points in groups of $d$, and the multiply the results with
$\oldphi$. More precisely, the following is $\Sigma_j$-equivariantly homotopy
commutative:
\[\xymatrix@C=3cm{\scrC(j)\times(X\times X)^j
\ar[r]^{(\theta\times\theta)_j}\ar[d]^{1\times\oldphi^j}&X\times X\ar[d]^\oldphi\\
\scrC(j)\times X\ar[r]^{\theta_j}&X
}\]
\end{itemise}
\end{lem*}
