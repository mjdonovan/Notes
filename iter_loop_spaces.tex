\section{Operads and \texorpdfstring{$\scrC$}{C}-spaces}
Let $\scrU$ be the category of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces and continuous
 maps. 
Let $\scrT$ be the same with nondegenerate basepoints.

An \emph{operad} $\scrC$ consists of spaces $\scrC(j)\in\scrU$ for $j\geq0$,
 with $\scrC(0)=*$, and maps
\[\gamma:\scrC(k)\times\scrC(j_1)\times\cdots\times\scrC(j_k)\to\scrC(j)
\text{ whenever }j=\sum j_i,\]
subject to certain restrictions. We should interpret the points of $\scrC(j)$ as
$j$-adic operations, and the restrictions reflect this interpretation.
$\gamma(c;d_1,\ldots,d_k)$ should be viewed as the operation which takes $j$
inputs, applies $d_1,\ldots,d_k$ to them in order, and then hits the list of
results with $c$.
\begin{itemise}
\item An associativity formula holds.
\item There's an identity $1\in\scrC(1)$ such that $\gamma(c;1^k)=c$ for all $c$.
\item There's a right action of $\Sigma_j$ on $\scrC(j)$ which should be viewed as
permutation of the arguments of an operation. There's an equivariance formula on
the function $\gamma$. An operad is $\Sigma$-free is $\Sigma_j$ acts freely for
each $j$. The equivariance formulae are:
\[\gamma(c\sigma;d_1,\ldots,d_k)=\gamma(c;d_{\sigma^{-1}1},\ldots,
d_{\sigma^{-1}k})\sigma'\text{ where }\sigma'\text{ acts in 
blocks of size $|d_i|$}.\]
\[\gamma(c;d_1\tau_1,\ldots,d_k\tau_k)=\gamma(c;d_1,\ldots,d_k)(\tau_1\oplus
\cdots\oplus\tau_k).\]
\end{itemise}
A morphism of operads is the only thing it could be. The \emph{endomorphism
operad} $\xi_X$ of $X\in\scrT$ has $\xi_X(j)$ the space of based maps $X^j\to
X$, with the only operad structure it could have. The axioms for an operad are
modeled on the obvious properties of $\xi_X$.

An operation $\theta$ of an operad $\scrC$ on a space is a morphism
$\theta:\scrC\to\xi_X$, and $(X,\theta)$ is then said to be a $\scrC$-space. These
form a category $\scrC[\scrT]$, whose morphisms consist of maps in $\scrT$ which
commute with the action.
\begin{thm*}[1.3]
There exist $\Sigma$-free operads $\scrC_n$ ($1\leq n\leq\infty$) such that every
$n$-fold loop space is a $\scrC_n$-space, and every connected $\scrC_n$-space
is weakly equivalent to an $n$-fold loop space. (The spaces $\scrC_n(j)$ are 
$(n-2)$-connected).
\end{thm*}
When $n=1$  (resp.\ $n=\infty$), $\scrC_1$ can be any $A_\infty$ 
(resp.\ $E_\infty$) operad, as defined later.

Let $\scrC$ be any operad and $X$ a $\scrC$-space. For any point
$c\in\scrC(1)$, $\theta_2(c):X^2\to X$ is a candidate multiplication.
Now if $\scrC(1)$ is connected, then $*$ is a two-sided homotopy identity, as
we can use any paths from $\gamma(c;1,*)$ to $1$, etc.
If moreover $\Sigma_2$ is connected, using the transposition we have that
$\theta_2(c)$ is homotopy commutative.

Note that Stasheff's $A_\infty$-space theory states that an $H$-space is of
the homotopy type of a loop space iff it has all possible higher coherence
homotopies for associativity.
\begin{lem*}[1.4]
An action $\theta:\scrC\to\xi_X$ determines and is determined by maps 
$\theta_j:\scrC(j)\times X^j\to X$ (adjoint to the maps $\scrC(j)\to\xi_X(j)$)
satisfying some coherences and equivariances, and morphisms of $\scrC$-spaces 
can be easily described in this language.
\end{lem*}
\begin{lem*}[1.5]
If $X\in\scrC[\scrT]$, and $(Y,A)$ is an NDR-pair in $\scrU$, then 
$\Map((Y,A),(X,*))=:X^{(Y,A)}$ is also a $\scrC$-space. (Note that operations
on $X$ give rise to operations on $X^{(Y,A)}$). In particular, $\scrC[\scrT]$ is
closed under taking path and loop spaces.
\end{lem*}
\begin{lem*}[1.6]
The one point space $*$ is a zero object in $\scrC[\scrT]$.
\end{lem*}
\begin{lem*}[1.7]
Given maps $X\to B$ and $Y\to B$ of $\scrC$-spaces, the fiber product is a 
$\scrC$-space, and is the fiber product in the category $\scrC[\scrT]$.
\end{lem*}
\begin{lem*}[1.8] We get a bunch of nice $\scrC$-morphisms from a $\scrC$-morphism
$X\to Y$ by taking a homotopy fiber-type diagram:
\[\xymatrix{
\makebox[2cm][r]{$\widetilde X=X\times_Y(Y^I)$}\ar[r]\ar[d]&Y^I\ar[d]\\
X\ar[r]&Y
}\]
In particular, we get an inclusion $i:X\to \widetilde X$,
retraction $r:\widetilde X\to X$, and fibration 
$\widetilde f:\widetilde X\to Y$.
\end{lem*}
\begin{lem*}[1.9]
Suppose $X\in\scrC[\scrT]$, and $c\in\scrC(2)$ is fixed, giving 
$\oldphi:=\theta(c):X^2\to X$. Let 
$\oldphi_j=\oldphi(1\times \oldphi_{j-1}):X^j\to X$ be the iterated product 
for each $j$.
\begin{itemise}
\item If $\scrC(j)$ is connected and $d\in\scrC(j)$, then $\theta(d)$ is 
homotopic to the iterated product $\oldphi_j$.
\item If $\scrC(j)$ is $\Sigma_j$-free and $\scrC(2j)$ is contractible, then given
$2j$ points of $X$ and a point $d\in\scrC(j)$, it is equivalent to either ``first
multiply the points in pairs using $\oldphi$, then apply $\theta(d)$'', or to apply 
$\theta(d)$ to the points in groups of $d$, and the multiply the results with
$\oldphi$. More precisely, the following is $\Sigma_j$-equivariantly homotopy
commutative:
\[\xymatrix@C=3cm{\scrC(j)\times(X\times X)^j
\ar[r]^{(\theta\times\theta)_j}\ar[d]^{1\times\oldphi^j}&X\times X\ar[d]^\oldphi\\
\scrC(j)\times X\ar[r]^{\theta_j}&X
}\]
\end{itemise}
\end{lem*}
\section{Operads and monads}
A monad $(C,\mu,\eta)$ in a category $\scrT$ is to be a monoid object in the category of endofunctors on $\scrT$. Explicitly, $C:\scrT\to\scrT$ is an endofunctor, and $\mu:C^2\to C$ and $\eta:1\to C$ are natural transformations such that:
\[\xymatrix@C=1.5cm{
CX\ar[r]^{C(\eta_X)}&CCX\ar[d]_{\mu_X}&CX\ar[l]_{\eta_{CX}}\\
&CX\ar@{=}[lu]\ar@{=}[ru]
}
\text{ and }
\xymatrix@C=1.5cm{
CCCX\ar[r]^{\mu_{CX}}\ar[d]_{C(\mu_X)}&CCX\ar[d]_{\mu_X}\\
CCX\ar[r]^{\mu_X}&CX
}
\]
If $\psi$ is a natural transformation $C\to C'$, we can define
$\psi^2:C^2\to (C')^2$ via either composite:
\[\xymatrix@C=1.5cm{
C^2X\ar[d]_{\psi_{CX}}\ar[r]^{C(\psi_X)}&CC'X\ar[d]^{\psi_{C'X}}\\
C'CX\ar[r]^{C'(\psi_X)}&(C')^2X
}\]
Then a morphism of monads is a natural transformation compatible with unit and
multiplication.

An algebra over a monad $C$ is an object $X\in\scrT$ with a map $\xi:CX\to X$
such that
\[\xymatrix{
X\ar[r]^\eta&CX\ar[d]\\
&X\ar@{=}[lu]
}\raisebox{-.67cm}{\text{ and }}
\xymatrix{
CCX\ar[r]^\mu\ar[d]^{c\xi}&CX\ar[d]_\xi\\
CX\ar[r]^\xi&X
}\]
The category of $C$-algebras and morphisms is denoted $C[\scrT]$.

\subsection{Constructing a monad from an operad}
Given an operad $\scrC$, there are maps $\sigma_i:\scrC(j)\to\scrC(j-1)$ for
$0\leq i<j$, essentially defined by substituting the basepoint in the \iTH
argument. That is by setting:
\[\sigma_ic:=\gamma(c;s_i)\text{ where }s_i:=1^i\times *\times1^{j-1-i}.\]
We can construct the monad associated to an operad $\scrC$ as follows. For any
$X\in\scrT$, define $CX:=\coprod_{j\geq0}\scrC(j)\times X^j/\approx$, where
$\approx$ is the relation generated by:
\begin{itemise}
\item $(\sigma_ic,y)\approx (c,s_iy)$ \ (i.e.\ 
compatibility with inclusions $X^{j-1}\to X^j$); and
\item $(c\sigma,y)\approx (c,\sigma y)$ \ (i.e.\ 
compatibility with $\Sigma_j$ action).
\end{itemise}
%Now $CCX$ is a quotient of the space
%$\coprod_{j,k}(\scrC(j)\times\scrC(k)\times X^{jk})$, so to define $\mu:CCX\to CX$
%it is enough to 
An element of $CCX$ consists of $c\in \scrC(k)$ and $k$ elements 
$(d_s,y_s)\in \scrC(j_s)\times X^{j_s}$. Now we could always sub the $d_s$
into $c$, which gives us the multiplication $\mu$ in our monad. That is:
\[\mu:CCX\to CX\text{ defined by }
\mu[c,([d_i,y_i])_{i=1}^{|c|}]:=[\gamma(c;(d_i)),(y_i)].\]
Of course, $\eta:X\to CX$ is nothing but $x\mapsto [1,x]$.

If $\pi\subset\Sigma_j$, 
and $\pi$ acts on $W\in\scrU$ from the right, we get a space:
\[e(W,\pi,X):=W\wedge_\pi X^{[j]}.\]
Now $CX$ is filtered by $F_kCX$, the image of
$\coprod_{j\leq k}\scrC(j)\times X^j$ in $CX$. It turns out that the inclusions
$F_{k-1}\subseteq F_{k}$ are cofibrations, and the quotient here is 
$e[\scrC(j),\Sigma_j,X]$. Moreover, $C$ is a limit and homotopy preserving
functor.

Now the $CX$ are in fact $\scrC$-spaces, and:
\begin{thm*}[2.7]
For the operads $\scrC_n$, there's a natural map of $\scrC$-spaces
$\alpha_n:C_nX\to\Omega^n\Sigma^nX$, which is a weak equivalence if $X$
is connected. In fact, $\Omega^n\Sigma^n$ is a monad, and 
$\alpha_n:C_n\to\Omega^n\Sigma^n$ is a map of monads.
\end{thm*}
\noindent
Note that the reason $\Omega^n\Sigma^n$ is a monad is that $F=\Sigma^n$
and $G=\Omega^n$ are adjoint functors, and thus $GF$ is a monad, whose unit is
the unit of the adjunction, and whose multiplication is $G\epsilon F$, where
$\epsilon$ is the counit of the adjunction. The unit-counit identities ensure
that $\mu$ and $\eta$ are compatible.
\begin{prop*}[2.8]
There's a 1-1 correspondence between $\scrC$-actions $\scrC\to\xi_X$ and 
$C$-algebra structure maps $\xi:CX\to X$, giving an equivalence of categories 
$\scrC[\scrT]\simeq C[\scrT]$. Here $\theta$ corresponds to $\xi$ iff for all $j$:
\[\xymatrix{\ar[rd]_{\theta_j}C(j)\ar[rr]^{\pi_j}&&CX\ar[dl]^\xi\\
&X}\]
\end{prop*}
\noindent
Use $\theta$ for $\xi$ from now on, so that the $\theta_j$ are just components
of a monad structure map.
\begin{lem*}[2.9]
Whenever $C$ is a monad, $CX$ is a $C$-algebra with structure map $\mu:CCX\to CX$.
Moveover, there is an adjunction $Q:\scrT\leftrightarrow C[\scrT]:U$, where $Q$
is $X\mapsto (CX,\mu)$, and $U$ is the forgetful functor. As such, $CX$ is
the free $\scrC$-space generated by $X$.
\end{lem*}
There is a converse result:
\begin{lem*}[2.10]
Given an adjuction $Q:\scrT\leftrightarrow \scrL:U$, $UQ$ is a monad, etc.
\end{lem*}

\section{\texorpdfstring{$A_\infty$ and $E_\infty$}{A and E} operads}
There are dicrete operads $\scrM$ and $\scrN$ such that a $\scrM$-algebra is 
precisely a topological monoid, and a $\scrN$-algebra is precisely a
commutative topological monoid.

Define $\scrM(j)=\Sigma_j$, which has identity element $e_j$. Define
$\gamma(e_k;e_{j_1},\ldots,e_{j_k}):=e_{j}$, and extend this using the
equivariance formulae. Define $\scrN(j)$ to be a single point, for every $j$.

The functors $M$ and $N$ are then the James construction and the infinite 
symmetric power respectively.
\subsection{Operads augmented over discrete operads}
Given an operad $\scrC$, we can take path components at each level to get a
discrete operad $\pi_0\scrC$. Any map from $\scrC$ to a discrete operad factors
through $\pi_0\scrC$. An operad over a discrete operad $\scrD$ is an operad
$\scrC$ with map $\scrC\to\scrD$ giving an isomorphism $\pi_\scrC\to\scrD$.
A morphism of operads over $\scrD$ is just one such that the triangle commutes.

An operad is $n$-connected if each of its spaces are. An operad is augmented over
$\scrN$ iff it is $0$-connected, in which case it has a unique augmentation.
An operad $\scrC$ can be augmented over $\scrM$ iff $\pi_0\scrC(j)$ is isomorphic
to $\Sigma_j$ as a $\Sigma_j$-set. To give an augmentation is to give a system
of compatible isomorphisms.

\subsection{Local (\texorpdfstring{$\Sigma$}{Sigma})-equivalence}
A morphism $\psi:\scrC\to\scrC'$ of operad is a local ($\Sigma$)-equivalence if
each $\scrC(j)\to\scrC'(j)$ is a ($\Sigma_j$-equivariant) homotopy equivalence.
These are \textbf{not} equivalence relations. However,
\begin{prop*}
Suppose $\psi$ is a morphism of operads over $\scrM$ of $\scrN$. Suppose that
either $\psi$ is a local $\Sigma$-equivalence, or that $\psi$ is a local
equivalence and the source and target are $\Sigma$-free. Then the maps
$\psi:CX\to C'X$ are weak equivalences for all connected spaces $X$.
\end{prop*}
\begin{proof}[Awesome proof]
As $\psi$ is an $H$-map of connected $H$-spaces, only need an $H_*(;\Z)$-equiv.
However, $CX$ is build from cofibrations with quotient $e[\scrC(j),\Sigma_j,X]$.
It's enough to show that the maps induced on these spaces are homology
equivalences, by the 5-lemma. Now if $\psi$ is a local $\Sigma$-equivalence, 
they are homotopy equivalences. Suppose instead that we only have $\Sigma$-freeness.
Then $\scrC(j)\wedge X^{[j]}\to\scrC(j)\wedge_{\Sigma_j} X^{[j]}$ is a covering
map, giving a SSS. The map $\psi_j$ induces an iso on the $E^2$ page, and so
on the $E^\infty$ page, as required.
\end{proof}
\begin{defn*}[3.5]
An $A_\infty$ operad is a $\Sigma$-free operad over $\scrM$ such that
$\eps:\scrC\to\scrM$ is a local $\Sigma$-equivalence.
An $E_\infty$ operad is a $\Sigma$-free operad over $\scrN$ such that 
$\scrC\to\scrN$ is a local equivalence.
 An $A_\infty$-space 
(resp.\ $E_\infty$) is a space over any $A_\infty$ (resp.\ $E_\infty$) operad.
\end{defn*}\noindent
Thus an operad $\scrC$ is $E^\infty$ iff each $\scrC(j)$ is an $E\Sigma_j$. 
This is one of the reasons we demand $\Sigma$-freeness. The other is to ensure
that $CX$ and $\Omega^\infty\Sigma^\infty X$ are weakly equivalent for any
connected $X$ and $E^\infty$ operad $\scrC$.
\begin{prop*}[3.6]
If $\scrC$ is an operad over $\scrN$ such that $\eps:\scrC\to\scrN$ is a local
$\Sigma$-equivalence, then any connected $\scrC$-space $X$ is weakly equivalent
to $\prod K(\pi_n(X),n)$.
\end{prop*}
\begin{proof}
By the definition of algebra over $N$, and of a map of monads $C\to N$:
\[\xymatrix{
X\ar[r]^\eta&CX\ar[d]^\theta\\
&X\ar@{=}[ul]
}
\raisebox{-.6cm}{\text{\qquad and\qquad}}
\xymatrix{
X\ar[dr]_{\eta}\ar[r]^\eta&CX\ar[d]^\eps\\
&NX
}\]
The functor $N$ is the infinite symmetric power, and it is well known that
$\eta_*:\pi_*(X)\to\pi_*(NX)=\widetilde H_*(X)$ is the Hurewicz homomorphism $h$.
Now $\eps$ is a weak equivalence, by 3.4, so we have $\theta\eps^{-1}h$ a weak
self equivalence of $NX$. So $h$ is the inclusion of a direct summand
$\pi_*(X)\to H_*(X)$. This is enough, by [18, thm 24.5].
\end{proof}
\begin{lem*}[3.7]
Any operad over $\scrM$ is $\Sigma$-free; any local equivalence of such is
in fact a $\Sigma$-equivalence.
Thus an $A_\infty$ operad is any which admits a local equivalence to $\scrM$.
\end{lem*}
The categorical product of operads is obtained simply by taking the product
of the spaces level-wise: $(\scrC\times\scrC')(j)=\scrC(j)\times\scrC'(j)$.
This construction sends a pair of operads over $\scrM$ to an operad over
$\scrM^2$, which is not so good.
\begin{defn*}[3.9]
Given operads $\eps:\scrC\to\scrM$ and $\eps':\scrC'\to\scrM$, let 
$\scrC\nabla\scrC'$ be the fibered product of $\eps$ and $\eps'$, which is
just the level-wise fibered product. Let $\eps\nabla\eps'$ be the obvious
map $\scrC\nabla\scrC'\to\scrM$.
\end{defn*}
\begin{prop*}[3.10]
If $\scrC$ is an $A_\infty$ operad an $\scrC'$ is any operad over $\scrM$, then
$\pi_2:\scrC\nabla\scrC'\to\scrC'$ is a local $\Sigma$-equivalence. If instead
$\scrC$ is $E_\infty$, and $\scrC'$ is any $\Sigma$-free operad,
$\pi_2:\scrC\times\scrC'\to\scrC'$ is a local equivalence of $\Sigma$-free
operads.
\end{prop*}\noindent
This shows that every $E_\infty$ space is an $A_\infty$ space, as if $\scrC$
is $E_\infty$, the map $\scrC\times\scrM\to\scrM$ is, by 3.7 and 3.10,
the structure map of an $A_\infty$ operad.
